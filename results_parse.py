        * That solver error is considered fixed if:

              - It is the final attempt but its second number is not 5.
    - A simulation error is counted once for any step that has >1 attempt.
      It is fixed if either the step is not the final step or (if final) the coin was found.
    
    Additionally, we determine abort counts:
      - abort_solver: 1 if the very final attempt is an unfixed solver error.
      - abort_simulation: 1 if the final step had a simulation error and it wasnâ€™t fixed.
