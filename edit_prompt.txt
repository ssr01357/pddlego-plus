        Please provide the output in JSON format, including the edit suggestions for a domain file as 'df' and the edit suggestions for a problem file as 'pf'. 
        The output format should be: {{"df": "...", "pf": "..."}}
        You will modify the following df and pf using add, delate, and replace operations (in a JSON format). 
        You SHOULD NOT provide a domain file and a problem file directly.
        This is the structure for df edit file, remember to add bracket:
        {
        "predicates": {
            "add": ["(predicates to add)"],
            "replace": {"(old)": "(new)"},
            "delete": ["(predicates to delete)"]
            },
        "action": {
            "open-door": {
                "precondition": ["(entire full new precondition for open-door)"], # directly replace the whole precondition
                "effect": ["(entire full new effect for open-door)"] # so as effect
                },
            "move": {
                "precondition": []
                "effect": []
                }
            }
        }
        This is the structure for pf edit file:
        {
        "objects": {
            "add": [],
            "replace": {},
            "delete": []
            },
        "init": {
            "add": [],
            "replace": {},
            "delete": []
            },
        "goal": ["(entire full new goal)"]
        }

        You are in an environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
        Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
        Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
        Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
        In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
        Here are your current observations: You are in the kitchen. To the South you see a closed patio door. To the West you see a closed plain door. 
        Here are some valid actions you can take: ['look around', 'close door to west', 'move west', 'open door to south', 'open door to west', 'inventory', 'move south', 'close door to south']
        You should generate df and pf strictly follow this valid actions. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:
        1. :action open-door
            :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
        2. :action move
            :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
        You should have a goal in the problem file like this: 
        (:goal 
            (at ?location)
        ) where location should be somewhere not visited

        This is previous domain file: (define (domain exploration)
    (:requirements :strips :typing)
    (:types location direction)
    (:predicates
        (at ?loc - location)
        (door-closed ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
        (connected ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
    )
    (:action open-door
        :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
        :precondition (door-closed ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir)
        :effect (not (door-closed ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir))
    )
    (:action move
        :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
        :precondition (and (at ?from) (connected ?from ?to ?dir) (not (door-closed ?from ?to ?dir)))
        :effect (and (not (at ?from)) (at ?to))
    )
)
        This is previous problem file: (define (problem explore-house)
    (:domain exploration)
    (:objects
        kitchen - location
        patio - location
        unknown-west - location
        south - direction
        west - direction
    )
    (:init
        (at kitchen)
        (door-closed kitchen patio south)
        (door-closed kitchen unknown-west west)
        (connected kitchen patio south)
        (connected kitchen unknown-west west)
    )
    (:goal
        (at patio)
    )
)

        Now modify those two files according to the new observations and notes. Generate updated ones based on your new observation.
