If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
Here are your current observations: Action: move north
You are in the backyard. Through an open patio door, to the North you see the kitchen. To the South you see the driveway. To the East you see the street. To the West you see a closed patio door. 

Action: move east
You are in the street. To the North you see a closed sliding door. To the West you see the backyard. 

Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to south', 'close door to west', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']
You should generate df and pf strictly follow these valid actions. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:
1. :action open-door
    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
2. :action move
    :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
You should have a goal in the problem file like this: 
(:goal 
    (at loc_2)  ; example of a grounded goal
) where the location should be somewhere not visited

Note:
In problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status.
The goal must be ground (e.g., (at loc_2)), never (at ?l) or quantifiers.


This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations: 
Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the South you see a closed patio door. To the West you see a closed plain door. 
Action: open door to south
You open the patio door, revealing the backyard. 
Action: move south
You are in the backyard. Through an open patio door, to the North you see the kitchen. To the South you see the driveway. To the East you see the street. To the West you see a closed patio door. 
Action: move south
You are in the driveway. To the North you see the backyard. 
Action: move north
You are in the backyard. Through an open patio door, to the North you see the kitchen. To the South you see the driveway. To the East you see the street. To the West you see a closed patio door. 
Action: move east
You are in the street. To the North you see a closed sliding door. To the West you see the backyard. 


You have already generate df and pf files according to the observations.
This is previous domain file: 
(define (domain kitchen-domain)
  (:requirements :strips :typing)
  (:types location direction)
  (:predicates
    (at ?l - location)
    (open ?l1 - location ?l2 - location ?d - direction)
    (closed ?l1 - location ?l2 - location ?d - direction))

  (:action open-door
    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
    :precondition (and (at ?loc1) (closed ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir))
    :effect (and (not (closed ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir)) (open ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir)))

  (:action move
    :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
    :precondition (and (at ?from) (open ?from ?to ?dir))
    :effect (and (not (at ?from)) (at ?to))))

This is previous problem file: 
(define (problem kitchen-exploration)
  (:domain kitchen-domain)
  (:objects
    kitchen backyard room_west backyard_west driveway street - location
    north south east west - direction)
  (:init
    (at driveway)
    (open kitchen backyard south)
    (open backyard kitchen north)
    (closed kitchen room_west west)
    (open backyard driveway south)
    (open driveway backyard north)
    (open backyard street east)
    (closed backyard backyard_west west))
  (:goal (at street)))


Now rewrite both the domain and problem files with the minimal fix.
