Observations: You are in the kitchen. In one part of the room you see a stove. There is also an oven. You also see a fridge that is closed. In another part of the room you see a counter that has a toaster on it. In one part of the room you see a kitchen cupboard that is closed. There is also a cutlery drawer that is closed. You also see a trash can that is closed. In another part of the room you see a dishwasher that is closed. In one part of the room you see a dining chair, that has nothing on it. 
To the South you see a closed patio door. To the West you see a closed plain door.  
Gold path: ['look around', 'open door to south', 'open door to west', 'move west', 'move east', 'move west', 'move east', 'move west', 'move east', 'move west', 'move east', 'move south', 'open door to west', 'move south', 'move north', 'move east', 'open door to north', 'move west', 'move east', 'move north', 'take coin'] 
Valid Actions: ['move west', 'close door to west', 'move south', 'inventory', 'look around', 'close door to south', 'open door to south', 'take toaster', 'open door to west'] 
taskDescription: Your task is to search the environment and find the coin.  Once you find the coin, take it. 
brief_obs: Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the South you see a closed patio door. To the West you see a closed plain door.

Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
The format should strictly be:

    }


You are in an environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
Here are your current observations: Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the South you see a closed patio door. To the West you see a closed plain door. 

Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to south', 'close door to west', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to south', 'open door to west', 'take toaster']
You should generate df and pf strictly follow these valid actions. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:
1. :action open-door
    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
2. :action move
    :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
You should have a goal in the problem file like this: 
(:goal 
    (at ?location)
) where location should be somewhere not visited
Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status

Based on the df and pf that you generated, the external solver could generate actions but after simulating in the game environment, it caused those errors: 
Action: move south
You can't move there, the door is closed. 
 

Now rewrite both the domain and problem files with the minimal fix.
 
Generated df and pf: 
 (define (domain exploration)
    (:requirements :strips :typing)
    (:types location direction)

    (:predicates
        (at ?loc - location)
        (door-closed ?from - location ?to - location)
        (door-open ?from - location ?to - location)
        (connected ?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
    )

    (:action open-door
        :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
        :precondition (and (at ?loc1) (door-closed ?loc1 ?loc2))
        :effect (and (door-open ?loc1 ?loc2) (not (door-closed ?loc1 ?loc2)))
    )

    (:action move
        :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
        :precondition (and (at ?from) (door-open ?from ?to) (connected ?from ?to ?dir))
        :effect (and (at ?to) (not (at ?from)))
    )
