    You are in an environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
    Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
    Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
    Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.

    Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
    The format should strictly be:
        {
        "df": "...",
        "pf": "..."
        }

    You are in an environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
    Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
    Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
    Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
    In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
    If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
    Here are your current observations: Action: move north
Unknown action: I'm not sure what you mean.

Action: move west
You are in the corridor. To the North you see a closed patio door. To the South you see a closed wood door. To the East you see the kitchen. To the West you see a closed wood door. 

    Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to south', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to south']
    You should generate df and pf strictly follow this valid actions. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:
    1. :action open-door
        :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
    2. :action move
        :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
    You should have a goal in the problem file like this: 
    (:goal 
        (at ?location)
    ) where ?location should be somewhere not visited, and must be ground (e.g., (at loc_2)), never (at ?l) or quantifiers.

    Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status

This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations: 
Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the South you see a closed frosted-glass door. To the West you see the corridor. 
Action: open door to south
You open the frosted-glass door, revealing the pantry. 
Action: move north
Unknown action: I'm not sure what you mean.
Action: move west
You are in the corridor. To the North you see a closed patio door. To the South you see a closed wood door. To the East you see the kitchen. To the West you see a closed wood door.

    Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
    The format should strictly be:
        {
        "df": "...",
        "pf": "..."
        }

    You are in an environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
    Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
    Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
    Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
    In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
    If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
    Here are your current observations: Action: open door to south
Unknown action: I'm not sure what you mean.

    Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to south', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to south']
    You should generate df and pf strictly follow this valid actions. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:
    1. :action open-door
        :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
    2. :action move
        :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
    You should have a goal in the problem file like this: 
    (:goal 
        (at ?location)
    ) where ?location should be somewhere not visited, and must be ground (e.g., (at loc_2)), never (at ?l) or quantifiers.

    Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status

This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations: 
Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the South you see a closed frosted-glass door. To the West you see the corridor. 
Action: open door to south
You open the frosted-glass door, revealing the pantry. 
Action: move north
Unknown action: I'm not sure what you mean.
Action: move west
You are in the corridor. To the North you see a closed patio door. To the South you see a closed wood door. To the East you see the kitchen. To the West you see a closed wood door. 
Action: open door to north
You open the patio door, revealing the backyard. 
Action: open door to west
You open the wood door, revealing the bathroom. 
Action: open door to south
You open the wood door, revealing the laundry room. 
Action: open door to south
That is already open. 
Action: move south
You are in the laundry room. Through an open wood door, to the North you see the corridor.

    Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
    The format should strictly be:

        }

    You are in an environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
    Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
    Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
    Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
    In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
    If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
    Here are your current observations: Action: open door to north
You open the wood door, revealing the living room. 

    Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to south', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to south']
    You should generate df and pf strictly follow this valid actions. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:
    1. :action open-door
        :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
    2. :action move
        :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
    You should have a goal in the problem file like this: 
    (:goal 
        (at ?location)
    ) where ?location should be somewhere not visited, and must be ground (e.g., (at loc_2)), never (at ?l) or quantifiers.

    Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status

This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations:

Prompt: 
    Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
    The format should strictly be:
        {
        "df": "...",
        "pf": "..."
        }

    You are in an environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
    Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
    Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
    Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
    In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
    If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
    Here are your current observations: Action: move west
You can't move there, the door is closed. 

Action: open door to west
You open the wood door, revealing the bedroom. 

Action: move north
Unknown action: I'm not sure what you mean.

Action: open door to east
You open the sliding patio door, revealing the backyard. 

    Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to south', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to south']
    You should generate df and pf strictly follow this valid actions. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:
    1. :action open-door
        :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
    2. :action move
        :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
    You should have a goal in the problem file like this: 
    (:goal 
        (at ?location)
    ) where ?location should be somewhere not visited, and must be ground (e.g., (at loc_2)), never (at ?l) or quantifiers.

    Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status

This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations: 
Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the South you see a closed frosted-glass door. To the West you see the corridor. 
Action: open door to south
You open the frosted-glass door, revealing the pantry. 
Action: move north
Unknown action: I'm not sure what you mean.

You have already generated df and pf files according to the observations.
This is previous domain file: 
(define (domain exploration-domain)
  (:requirements :strips :typing)
  (:types location direction)
  (:constants south west north east - direction)
  (:predicates
    (at ?loc - location)
    (closed ?dir - direction ?from - location ?to - location)
    (direction ?dir - direction ?from - location ?to - location)
  )
  (:action open-door
    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
    :precondition (and (at ?loc1) (closed ?dir ?loc1 ?loc2))
    :effect (and (not (closed ?dir ?loc1 ?loc2)) (at ?loc2))
  )
  (:action move
    :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
    :precondition (and (at ?from) (direction ?dir ?from ?to))
    :effect (and (not (at ?from)) (at ?to))
  ))

This is previous problem file: 
(define (problem exploration-problem)
  (:domain exploration-domain)
  (:objects kitchen - location corridor - location pantry - location backyard - location bathroom - location laundry-room - location living-room - location patio - location)
  (:init
    (at kitchen)
    (direction south kitchen pantry)
    (direction west kitchen corridor)
    (direction north corridor bathroom)
    (direction south corridor kitchen)
    (direction east corridor pantry)
    (direction north corridor backyard)
    (direction south corridor laundry-room)
    (direction west corridor bathroom)
    (direction south bathroom corridor)
    (direction north bathroom living-room)
    (closed south kitchen pantry)
    (closed west kitchen corridor)
    (closed south corridor laundry-room)
    (closed west corridor bathroom)
    (closed south bathroom corridor)
    (closed east living-room patio)
  )
  (:goal (at patio)))


Now rewrite both the domain and problem files with the minimal fix.
