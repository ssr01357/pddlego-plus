You also see a trash can that is closed. In another part of the room you see a dishwasher that is closed. In one part of the room you see a dining chair, that has nothing on it.

You are in an environment that you explore step by step. Your task is to generate a PDDL domain file ('df') based on the observations and valid actions.
Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.

You are in the kitchen. To the South you see a closed frosted-glass door. To the West you see the corridor. 

Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to south', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to south']

You should generate a df that strictly follows these valid actions. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:

Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.

You are in an environment that you explore step by step. Your output must be one single, complete PDDL problem file. To create it, add a `(:goal ...)` section to the provided objects and initial state, then wrap everything in the standard `(define (problem ...))` structure.

Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
In other words, your goal should be to go to another not visited location.

    You are in an environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
    Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.

    Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
    In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
    If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
    Here are your current observations: Action: open door to north
You open the patio door, revealing the backyard. 

Action: move north
You are in the backyard. Through an open patio door, to the South you see the corridor. To the East you see the driveway. To the West you see a closed sliding patio door. 

    Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to south', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to south']
    You should generate df and pf strictly follow this valid actions. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:
