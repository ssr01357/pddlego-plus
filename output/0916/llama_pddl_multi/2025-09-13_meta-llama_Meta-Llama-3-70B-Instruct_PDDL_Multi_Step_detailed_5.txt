In another part of the room you see a counter, that has nothing on it. In one part of the room you see a kitchen cupboard that is closed. There is also a cutlery drawer that is closed. You also see a trash can that is closed. In another part of the room you see a dishwasher that is closed. In one part of the room you see a dining chair, that has nothing on it. 
To the North you see a closed wood door. To the South you see a closed patio door. To the East you see the living room. To the West you see a closed frosted-glass door.

You are in an environment that you explore step by step. Your task is to generate a PDDL domain file ('df') based on the observations and valid actions.
Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.

Here are your current observations: Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see a closed wood door. To the South you see a closed patio door. To the East you see the living room. To the West you see a closed frosted-glass door.

You should generate a df that strictly follows these valid actions. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:

You are in an environment that you explore step by step. Your task is to define the objects and the initial state for a PDDL problem file ('pf') based on the provided domain file ('df') and your current observations from the environment.
**DO NOT** generate the `(:goal ...)` section in this step. 

Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.

If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.

You are in an environment that you explore step by step. Your output must be one single, complete PDDL problem file. To create it, add a `(:goal ...)` section to the provided objects and initial state, then wrap everything in the standard `(define (problem ...))` structure.

Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
In other words, your goal should be to go to another not visited location.

    If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
    Here are your current observations: Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see a closed wood door. To the South you see a closed patio door. To the East you see the living room. To the West you see a closed frosted-glass door. 

    Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to north', 'close door to south', 'close door to west', 'move east', 'move north', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to north', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']
    You should generate df and pf strictly follow this valid actions. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:
    1. :action open-door
        :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
    2. :action move
        :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
    You should have a goal in the problem file like this: 
    (:goal 
        (at ?location)
    ) where ?location should be somewhere not visited, and must be ground (e.g., (at loc_2)), never (at ?l) or quantifiers.

    Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status

This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations: 
None

You have already generated df and pf files according to the observations.
This is previous domain file: 
(define (domain kitchen-domain) (:requirements :typing) (:types location direction) (:predicates (is-open?loc1?loc2?dir) (is-closed?loc1?loc2?dir) (is-connected?loc1?loc2?dir)) (:action open-door (:parameters (?loc1 - location?loc2 - location?dir - direction)) (:preconditions (and (is-closed?loc1?loc2?dir))) (:effects (and (not (is-closed?loc1?loc2?dir)) (is-open?loc1?loc2?dir)))) (:action move (:parameters (?from - location?to - location?dir - direction)) (:preconditions (and (is-open?from?to?dir))) (:effects (and (not (is-connected?from?to?dir)) (is-connected?to?from?dir)))))

This is previous problem file: 
(define (problem kitchen-problem) (:domain kitchen-domain) (:objects (kitchen living-room wood-door patio-door frosted-glass-door north south west east)) (:init (and (is-closed kitchen kitchen north) (is-closed kitchen kitchen south) (is-closed kitchen kitchen west) (is-connected kitchen living-room east))) (:goal (at living-room)))


You made some mistakes when generating those files. Here is the error message: 
/tmp/pddl_run_nu4v54ed/domain.pddl: syntax error in line 1, '(':
domain definition expected


Now rewrite both the domain and problem files with the minimal fix.
 
Generated df and pf:
