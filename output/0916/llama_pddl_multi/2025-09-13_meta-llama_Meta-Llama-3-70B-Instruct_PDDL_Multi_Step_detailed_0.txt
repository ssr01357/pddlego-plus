Observations: You are in the kitchen. In one part of the room you see a stove. There is also an oven. You also see a fridge that is closed. In another part of the room you see a counter, that has nothing on it. In one part of the room you see a kitchen cupboard that is closed. There is also a cutlery drawer that is closed. You also see a trash can that is closed. In another part of the room you see a dishwasher that is closed. In one part of the room you see a dining chair, that has nothing on it. 
To the North you see a closed wood door. To the East you see a closed frosted-glass door. To the West you see the corridor.

You are in an environment that you explore step by step. Your task is to generate a PDDL domain file ('df') based on the observations and valid actions.
Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.

Here are your current observations: Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see a closed wood door. To the East you see a closed frosted-glass door. To the West you see the corridor. 

Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to east', 'close door to north', 'move east', 'move north', 'move west', 'open door to east', 'open door to north']

You should generate a df that strictly follows these valid actions. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:
1. :action open-door
    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
2. :action move

You are in an environment that you explore step by step. Your task is to define the objects and the initial state for a PDDL problem file ('pf') based on the provided domain file ('df') and your current observations from the environment.
**DO NOT** generate the `(:goal ...)` section in this step. 

Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.

If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.

This is the domain file: (define (domain kitchen_domain) (:requirements) (:types location direction) (:predicates (is-open?loc1?loc2?dir) (is-closed?loc1?loc2?dir) (is-at?loc)) (:actions (:action open-door (:parameters (?loc1 - location?loc2 - location?dir - direction)) (:preconditions (and (is-at?loc1) (is-closed?loc1?loc2?dir))) (:effects (and (is-open?loc1?loc2?dir) (not (is-closed?loc1?loc2?dir))))) (:action move (:parameters (?from - location?to - location?dir - direction)) (:preconditions (and (is-at?from) (is-open?from?to?dir))) (:effects (and (is-at?to) (not (is-at?from)))))))
    
Here are your current observations: Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see a closed wood door. To the East you see a closed frosted-glass door. To the West you see the corridor. 

Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to east', 'close door to north', 'move east', 'move north', 'move west', 'open door to east', 'open door to north']

 Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status.

You are in an environment that you explore step by step. Your output must be one single, complete PDDL problem file. To create it, add a `(:goal ...)` section to the provided objects and initial state, then wrap everything in the standard `(define (problem ...))` structure.

Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
In other words, your goal should be to go to another not visited location.

You have already generated df and pf files according to the observations.
This is previous domain file: 
(define (domain kitchen_domain) (:requirements :typing) (:types location direction) (:predicates (is-open?loc1?loc2?dir) (is-closed?loc1?loc2?dir) (is-at?loc)) (:actions (open-door (:parameters (?loc1 - location?loc2 - location?dir - direction)) (:preconditions (and (is-at?loc1) (is-closed?loc1?loc2?dir))) (:effects (and (is-open?loc1?loc2?dir) (not (is-closed?loc1?loc2?dir))))) (move (:parameters (?from - location?to - location?dir - direction)) (:preconditions (and (is-at?from) (is-open?from?to?dir))) (:effects (and (is-at?to) (not (is-at?from)))))))

This is previous problem file: 
(define (problem kitchen_problem) (:domain kitchen_domain) (:objects (kitchen corridor east_room north_room wood_door frosted_glass_door)) (:init (and (is-at kitchen) (is-closed kitchen north_room north) (is-closed kitchen east_room east) (is-open kitchen corridor west))) (:goal (at corridor)))


You made some mistakes when generating those files. Here is the error message: 
/tmp/pddl_run_wyywt0h7/domain.pddl: syntax error in line 1, ':ACTIONS':
domain definition expected


Now rewrite both the domain and problem files with the minimal fix.
