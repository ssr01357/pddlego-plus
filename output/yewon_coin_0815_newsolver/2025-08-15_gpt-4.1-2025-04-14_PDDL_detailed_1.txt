Actions from solver(df, pf): None 
--Small Loop--: 4 
Error: None 
Prompt: 
    Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
    The format should strictly be:
        {
        "df": "...",
        "pf": "..."
        }

    You are in an environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
    Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
    Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
    Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
    In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
    If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
    Here are your current observations: Action: open door to patio-door
Unknown action: I'm not sure what you mean.

    Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to south', 'close door to west', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to south', 'open door to west', 'take toaster']
    You should generate df and pf strictly follow this valid actions. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:
    1. :action open-door
        :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
    2. :action move
        :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
    You should have a goal in the problem file like this: 
    (:goal 
        (at ?location)
    ) where location should be somewhere not visited
    Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status

    This is previous domain file: (define (domain explore)
  (:requirements :strips :typing)
  (:types location direction)
  (:predicates 
    (at ?loc - location)
    (visited ?loc - location)
    (connects ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
  )

  (:action open-door
    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
    :precondition (and (at ?loc1) (connects ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir))
    :effect ()
  )

  (:action move
    :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
    :precondition (and (at ?from) (connects ?from ?to ?dir))
    :effect (and (at ?to) (visited ?to) (not (at ?from)))
  )
)

    This is previous problem file: (define (problem explore-kitchen)
  (:domain explore)
  (:objects 
    kitchen - location
    unknown1 - location
    unknown2 - location
    south - direction
    west - direction
  )
  (:init 
    (at kitchen)
    (visited kitchen)
    (connects kitchen unknown1 south)
    (connects kitchen unknown2 west)
  )
  (:goal 
    (or (at unknown1) (at unknown2))
  )
)

    This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations: Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the South you see a closed patio door. To the West you see a closed plain door. 


    You made some mistakes when generating those files. Here is the error message: None; ── SOLVER LOG ─────────────────────────────────
                    /tmp/pddl_run_z1h572vt/domain.pddl: syntax error in line 13, ')':
domain definition expected
                    ── VAL LOG ────────────────────────────────────
    Now modify those two files according to the error message.

    You have already generate files according to the observations. The df and pf can generate actions but after simulating,
    it got those errors: This is the action you take: open door to patio-door.                                         When you try to open door, there is no door here or there is nothing in this direction.                                        If there is no door, you can directly move to that direction.
. Please review both files and fix them.
    Now modify those two files according to the error message.
