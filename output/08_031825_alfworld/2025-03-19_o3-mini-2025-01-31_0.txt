Prompt: 
        Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
        The format should strictly be:

        You are in an environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
        Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations.
        Your task is to: put some soapbottle on cart.
        Here are your current observations: Action: look around
You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you see a bathtubbasin 1, a cart 1, a countertop 1, a drawer 4, a drawer 3, a drawer 2, a drawer 1, a garbagecan 1, a handtowelholder 1, a shelf 1, a sinkbasin 1, a toilet 1, a toiletpaperhanger 1, and a towelholder 1.

        Here are some valid actions you can take: ['go to bathtubbasin 1', 'go to cart 1', 'go to countertop 1', 'go to drawer 1', 'go to drawer 2', 'go to drawer 3', 'go to drawer 4', 'go to garbagecan 1', 'go to handtowelholder 1', 'go to shelf 1', 'go to sinkbasin 1', 'go to toilet 1', 'go to toiletpaperhanger 1', 'go to towelholder 1', 'help', 'inventory', 'look']
        You should generate df and pf strictly follow this valid actions.
