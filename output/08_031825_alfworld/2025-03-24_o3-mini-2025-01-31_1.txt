        You are in an environment that you must explore step by step. Your task is to build and update PDDL files for the environment using only your direct observations. Do not create or assume any objects, relationships, or details that have not been observed, and ensure you include all observations.

        The environment is a room containing various objects. Some of these objects are on, in, or contained within other objects and receptacles.
        
        Now, Your task is to: put some cloth on bathtubbasin.
        Here are your current observations: Action: look around
You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you see a bathtubbasin 1, a cabinet 5, a cabinet 4, a cabinet 3, a cabinet 2, a cabinet 1, a countertop 1, a garbagecan 1, a handtowelholder 2, a handtowelholder 1, a sinkbasin 1, a toilet 1, a toiletpaperhanger 1, and a towelholder 1.


        The following actions are allowed:

            :action GotoLocation
            :parameters (?l - location ?r - receptacle)
        2. open an object/receptacle
            :action OpenObject

        3. close an object/receptacle

        7. examine an object/receptacle
            :action examineReceptacle
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        8. using an object/receptacle by turning it on/off with a switch
        9. heat an object with another object/receptacle
            :action HeatObject
            :parameters (?l - location ?r - receptacle ?o - object)
        10. clean an object with another object/receptacle
            :action CleanObject
            :parameters (?l - location ?r - receptacle ?o - object)
        11. cool an object with another object/receptacle

        13. look around.

        You must go to a location in order to use it or take/put objects on it.

        There should have two stages:
        1. You should first find this objects by keeping exploration and going to a location you have not visited yet. 
        In other words, initially, your objective is to explore new locations until you discover the object mentioned in the task.
        In this first stage, you may only use action GotoLocation to explore new locations and OpenObject if it is closed to check if that object is what we want.
            (:goal 
                (at ?location)
            ) where location should be somewhere not visited
            (:goal 
                (opened ?location)
            ) if the visited location is closed and you need to open it to check the object
        After you go the that location and found the object in it, you can update your goal to stage two.

        2. Once you have located the object, update your goal to use the object to complete the task.

        You must go to a location in order to use it or take/put objects on it.

        There should have two stages:
        1. You should first find this objects by keeping exploration and going to a location you have not visited yet. 
        In other words, initially, your objective is to explore new locations until you discover the object mentioned in the task.
        In this first stage, you may only use action GotoLocation to explore new locations and OpenObject if it is closed to check if that object is what we want.
            (:goal 
                (at ?location)
            ) where location should be somewhere not visited
            (:goal 
                (opened ?location)
            ) if the visited location is closed and you need to open it to check the object
        After you go the that location and found the object in it, you can update your goal to stage two.

        2. Once you have located the object, update your goal to use the object to complete the task.

        You must go to a location in order to use it or take/put objects on it.

        There should have two stages:
        1. You should first find this objects by keeping exploration and going to a location you have not visited yet. 
        In other words, initially, your objective is to explore new locations until you discover the object mentioned in the task.
        In this first stage, you may only use action GotoLocation to explore new locations and OpenObject if it is closed to check if that object is what we want.
            (:goal 
                (at ?location)
            ) where location should be somewhere not visited
            (:goal 
                (opened ?location)
            ) if the visited location is closed and you need to open it to check the object
        After you go the that location and found the object in it, you can update your goal to stage two.

        2. Once you have located the object, update your goal to use the object to complete the task.

        You must go to a location in order to use it or take/put objects on it.

        There should have two stages:
        1. You should first find this objects by keeping exploration and going to a location you have not visited yet. 
        In other words, initially, your objective is to explore new locations until you discover the object mentioned in the task.
        In this first stage, you may only use action GotoLocation to explore new locations and OpenObject if it is closed to check if that object is what we want.
            (:goal 
                (at ?location)
            ) where location should be somewhere not visited
            (:goal 
                (opened ?location)
            ) if the visited location is closed and you need to open it to check the object
        After you go the that location and found the object in it, you can update your goal to stage two.

        2. Once you have located the object, update your goal to use the object to complete the task.

        You must go to a location in order to use it or take/put objects on it.

        There should have two stages:
        1. You should first find this objects by keeping exploration and going to a location you have not visited yet. 
        In other words, initially, your objective is to explore new locations until you discover the object mentioned in the task.
        In this first stage, you may only use action GotoLocation to explore new locations and OpenObject if it is closed to check if that object is what we want.
            (:goal 
                (at ?location)
            ) where location should be somewhere not visited
            (:goal 
                (opened ?location)
            ) if the visited location is closed and you need to open it to check the object
        After you go the that location and found the object in it, you can update your goal to stage two.

        2. Once you have located the object, update your goal to use the object to complete the task.
