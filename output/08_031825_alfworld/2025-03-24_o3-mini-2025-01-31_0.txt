        The environment is a room containing various objects. Some of these objects are on, in, or contained within other objects and receptacles.
        
        Now, Your task is to: put a cloth in bathtubbasin.
        Here are your current observations: Action: look around

        13. look around.

        You must go to a location in order to use it or take/put objects on it.

        There should have two stages:
        1. You should first find this objects by keeping exploration and going to a location you have not visited yet. 
        In other words, initially, your objective is to explore new locations until you discover the object mentioned in the task.
        In this first stage, you may only use action GotoLocation to explore new locations.
            (:goal 
                (at ?location)
            ) where location should be somewhere not visited
        After you go the that location and found the object in it, you can update your goal to stage two.

        2. Once you have located the object, update your goal to use the object to complete the task.

        You must go to a location in order to use it or take/put objects on it.

        There should have two stages:
        1. You should first find this objects by keeping exploration and going to a location you have not visited yet. 
        In other words, initially, your objective is to explore new locations until you discover the object mentioned in the task.
        In this first stage, you may only use action GotoLocation to explore new locations.
            (:goal 
                (at ?location)
            ) where location should be somewhere not visited
        After you go the that location and found the object in it, you can update your goal to stage two.

        2. Once you have located the object, update your goal to use the object to complete the task.

        You must go to a location in order to use it or take/put objects on it.

        There should have two stages:
        1. You should first find this objects by keeping exploration and going to a location you have not visited yet. 
        In other words, initially, your objective is to explore new locations until you discover the object mentioned in the task.
        In this first stage, you may only use action GotoLocation to explore new locations.
            (:goal 
                (at ?location)
            ) where location should be somewhere not visited
        After you go the that location and found the object in it, you can update your goal to stage two.

        2. Once you have located the object, update your goal to use the object to complete the task.

        You must go to a location in order to use it or take/put objects on it.

        There should have two stages:
        1. You should first find this objects by keeping exploration and going to a location you have not visited yet. 
        In other words, initially, your objective is to explore new locations until you discover the object mentioned in the task.
        In this first stage, you may only use action GotoLocation to explore new locations.
            (:goal 
                (at ?location)
            ) where location should be somewhere not visited
        After you go the that location and found the object in it, you can update your goal to stage two.

        2. Once you have located the object, update your goal to use the object to complete the task.
