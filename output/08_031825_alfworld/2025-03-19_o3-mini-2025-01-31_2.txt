        You are in a room with different objects. Some objects are on/in other objects and receptacles. Your job is to compete the given task.

        The following actions are allowed: go to a location, open an object/receptacle, close an object/receptacle, take an object from another object/receptacle, put object into/on/in another object/receptacle, check inventory, examine an object/receptacle, using an object/receptacle by turning it on/off with a switch, heat an object with another object/receptacle, clean an object with another object/receptacle, cool an object with another object/receptacle, slice an object with another object/receptacle, and look around.

        You must go to a location in order to use it or take/put objects on it.
