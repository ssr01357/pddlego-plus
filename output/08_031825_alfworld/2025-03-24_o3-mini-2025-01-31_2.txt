        Now, Your task is to: put some cloth on bathtubbasin.

        There should have two stages:
        1. You should first find this objects by keeping exploration and going to a location you have not visited yet. 
        In other words, initially, your objective is to explore new locations until you discover the object mentioned in the task.
            (:goal

        2. Once you have located the object, update your goal to use the object to complete the task.

Prompt: 
        Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
        The format should strictly be:
            {
            "df": "...",
            "pf": "..."
            }
    
        You are in an environment that you must explore step by step. Your task is to build and update PDDL files for the environment using only your direct observations. Do not create or assume any objects, relationships, or details that have not been observed, and ensure you include all observations.

        The environment is a room containing various objects. Some of these objects are on, in, or contained within other objects and receptacles.
        
        The following actions are allowed: 
        1. go to a location
            :action GotoLocation
            :parameters (?a - agent ?lStart - location ?lEnd - location ?r - receptacle)
        2. open an object/receptacle
            :action OpenObject
            :parameters (?a - agent ?l - location ?r - receptacle)
        3. close an object/receptacle
            :action CloseObject
            :parameters (?a - agent ?l - location ?r - receptacle)
        4. take an object from another object/receptacle
            :action PickupObject
            :parameters (?a - agent ?l - location ?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        5. put object into/on/in another object/receptacle
            :action PutObject
            :parameters (?a - agent ?l - location ?o - object ?r - receptacle ?ot - otype ?rt - rtype)
        6. check inventory
        7. examine an object/receptacle
            :action examineReceptacle
            :parameters (?a - agent ?r - receptacle)
        8. using an object/receptacle by turning it on/off with a switch
        9. heat an object with another object/receptacle
            :action HeatObject
            :parameters (?a - agent ?l - location ?r - receptacle ?o - object)
        10. clean an object with another object/receptacle
            :action CleanObject
            :parameters (?a - agent ?l - location ?r - receptacle ?o - object)
        11. cool an object with another object/receptacle
            :action CoolObject
            :parameters (?a - agent ?l - location ?r - receptacle ?o - object)
        12. slice an object with another object/receptacle
            :action SliceObject
            :parameters (?a - agent ?l - location ?co - object ?ko - object)
        13. look around.

        You must go to a location in order to use it or take/put objects on it.

        Now, Your task is to: put some cloth on bathtubbasin.

        There should have two stages:
        1. You should first find this objects by keeping exploration and going to a location you have not visited yet. 
        In other words, initially, your objective is to explore new locations until you discover the object mentioned in the task.
            (:goal 
                (at ?location)
            ) where location should be somewhere not visited

        2. Once you have located the object, update your goal to use the object to complete the task.

        Here are your current observations: Action: look around
You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you see a bathtubbasin 1, a cabinet 5, a cabinet 4, a cabinet 3, a cabinet 2, a cabinet 1, a countertop 1, a garbagecan 1, a handtowelholder 2, a handtowelholder 1, a sinkbasin 1, a toilet 1, a toiletpaperhanger 1, and a towelholder 1.
