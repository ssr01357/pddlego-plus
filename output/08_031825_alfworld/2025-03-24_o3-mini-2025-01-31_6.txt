        You are in an environment that you must explore step by step. Your task is to build and update PDDL files for the environment using only your direct observations. Do not create or assume any objects, relationships, or details that have not been observed, and ensure you include all observations.

        The environment is a room containing various objects. Some of these objects are on, in, or contained within other objects and receptacles.
        
        Now, Your task is to: put some cloth on bathtubbasin.
        Here are your current observations: Action: look around
You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you see a bathtubbasin 1, a cabinet 5, a cabinet 4, a cabinet 3, a cabinet 2, a cabinet 1, a countertop 1, a garbagecan 1, a handtowelholder 2, a handtowelholder 1, a sinkbasin 1, a toilet 1, a toiletpaperhanger 1, and a towelholder 1.


        The following actions are allowed: 
        1. go to a location
            :action GotoLocation
            :parameters (?from - location ?to - location)
        2. open an object/receptacle if it is closed
            :action OpenObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        3. close an object/receptacle
            :action CloseObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        4. take an object from another object/receptacle
            :action PickupObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        5. put object into/on/in another object/receptacle

            :parameters (?l - location ?o - object ?r - receptacle ?ot - otype ?rt - rtype)
        6. check inventory
        7. examine an object/receptacle
            :action examineReceptacle
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        8. using an object/receptacle by turning it on/off with a switch
        9. heat an object with another object/receptacle
            :action HeatObject
            :parameters (?l - location ?r - receptacle ?o - object)
        10. clean an object with another object/receptacle
            :action CleanObject
            :parameters (?l - location ?r - receptacle ?o - object)
        11. cool an object with another object/receptacle
            :action CoolObject
            :parameters (?l - location ?r - receptacle ?o - object)
        12. slice an object with another object/receptacle
            :action SliceObject
            :parameters (?l - location ?co - object ?ko - object)
        13. look around.

        You must go to a location in order to use it or take/put objects on it.

        The process involves two main stages:

        1. Searching for the Object:
            In this stage, your goal is to explore new, unvisited locations until you find the object mentioned in the task. You can only use the GotoLocation action to travel to a new location and the OpenObject action (if the location is closed) to verify whether it contains the target object.

            Goal 1.1: Reach a location that has not been visited (the location should be a receptacle) using the GotoLocation action. 
                You goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (at ?location)
                ) where location should be somewhere or some recepatacle not visited.

            Goal 1.2: If you already go to the recepatacle and found the recepatacle is closed, use the OpenObject action to open it and inspect the contents. 
                Your goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (opened ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be the recepatacle you want to open.

        2. Using the Object to Complete the Task:
            Once you have found the object, update your goal to focus on using it to complete the task.
            You need to first use the PickupObject action to take the object from a receptacle, then go to the aiming location by using GotoLocation action, and then put it into another receptacle.
            Or use it in some other way to complete the task.

        In summary, the first stage is all about finding the objectâ€”this might involve traveling to a location and opening it if necessary.
        
        Note, some receptacles have numbers in their names. Always keep them as they are. For example, "towelholder1" should not be changed to "towelholder".
        Your initial goal should always be to go to a new location instead of put something into somewhere.

You arrive at cabinet 5. The cabinet 5 is closed.

            :action SliceObject
            :parameters (?l - location ?co - object ?ko - object)
        13. look around.

        You must go to a location in order to use it or take/put objects on it.

        The process involves two main stages:

        1. Searching for the Object:
            In this stage, your goal is to explore new, unvisited locations until you find the object mentioned in the task. You can only use the GotoLocation action to travel to a new location and the OpenObject action (if the location is closed) to verify whether it contains the target object.

            Goal 1.1: Reach a location that has not been visited (the location should be a receptacle) using the GotoLocation action. 
                You goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (at ?location)
                ) where location should be somewhere or some recepatacle not visited.

            Goal 1.2: If you already go to the recepatacle and found the recepatacle is closed, use the OpenObject action to open it and inspect the contents. 
                Your goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (opened ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be the recepatacle you want to open.

        2. Using the Object to Complete the Task:
            Once you have found the object, update your goal to focus on using it to complete the task.
            You need to first use the PickupObject action to take the object from a receptacle, then go to the aiming location by using GotoLocation action, and then put it into another receptacle.
            Or use it in some other way to complete the task.

        In summary, the first stage is all about finding the objectâ€”this might involve traveling to a location and opening it if necessary.
        
        Note, some receptacles have numbers in their names. Always keep them as they are. For example, "towelholder1" should not be changed to "towelholder".
        Your initial goal should always be to go to a new location instead of put something into somewhere.

        13. look around.

        You must go to a location in order to use it or take/put objects on it.

        The process involves two main stages:

        1. Searching for the Object:
            In this stage, your goal is to explore new, unvisited locations until you find the object mentioned in the task. You can only use the GotoLocation action to travel to a new location and the OpenObject action (if the location is closed) to verify whether it contains the target object.

            Goal 1.1: Reach a location that has not been visited (the location should be a receptacle) using the GotoLocation action. 
                You goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (at ?location)
                ) where location should be somewhere or some recepatacle not visited.

            Goal 1.2: If you already go to the recepatacle and found the recepatacle is closed, use the OpenObject action to open it and inspect the contents. 
                Your goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (opened ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be the recepatacle you want to open.

        2. Using the Object to Complete the Task:
            Once you have found the object, update your goal to focus on using it to complete the task.
            You need to first use the PickupObject action to take the object from a receptacle, then go to the aiming location by using GotoLocation action, and then put it into another receptacle.
            Or use it in some other way to complete the task.

        In summary, the first stage is all about finding the objectâ€”this might involve traveling to a location and opening it if necessary.
        
        Note, some receptacles have numbers in their names. Always keep them as they are. For example, "towelholder1" should not be changed to "towelholder".
        Your initial goal should always be to go to a new location instead of put something into somewhere.

        The environment is a room containing various objects. Some of these objects are on, in, or contained within other objects and receptacles.
        
        Now, Your task is to: put some cloth on bathtubbasin.
        Here are your current observations: Action: go to bathtubbasin 1
You arrive at bathtubbasin 1. On the bathtubbasin 1, you see nothing.

        6. check inventory
        7. examine an object/receptacle
            :action examineReceptacle
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        8. using an object/receptacle by turning it on/off with a switch
        9. heat an object with another object/receptacle
            :action HeatObject
            :parameters (?l - location ?r - receptacle ?o - object)
        10. clean an object with another object/receptacle
            :action CleanObject
            :parameters (?l - location ?r - receptacle ?o - object)
        11. cool an object with another object/receptacle
            :action CoolObject
            :parameters (?l - location ?r - receptacle ?o - object)
        12. slice an object with another object/receptacle
            :action SliceObject
            :parameters (?l - location ?co - object ?ko - object)
        13. look around.

        You must go to a location in order to use it or take/put objects on it.

        The process involves two main stages:

        1. Searching for the Object:
            In this stage, your goal is to explore new, unvisited locations until you find the object mentioned in the task. You can only use the GotoLocation action to travel to a new location and the OpenObject action (if the location is closed) to verify whether it contains the target object.

            Goal 1.1: Reach a location that has not been visited (the location should be a receptacle) using the GotoLocation action. 
                You goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (at ?location)
                ) where location should be somewhere or some recepatacle not visited.

            Goal 1.2: If you already go to the recepatacle and found the recepatacle is closed, use the OpenObject action to open it and inspect the contents. 
                Your goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (opened ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be the recepatacle you want to open.

        2. Using the Object to Complete the Task:
            Once you have found the object, update your goal to focus on using it to complete the task.
            You need to first use the PickupObject action to take the object from a receptacle, then go to the aiming location by using GotoLocation action, and then put it into another receptacle.
            Or use it in some other way to complete the task.

        In summary, the first stage is all about finding the objectâ€”this might involve traveling to a location and opening it if necessary.
        
        Note, some receptacles have numbers in their names. Always keep them as they are. For example, "towelholder1" should not be changed to "towelholder".
        Your initial goal should always be to go to a new location instead of put something into somewhere.

        The environment is a room containing various objects. Some of these objects are on, in, or contained within other objects and receptacles.
        
        Now, Your task is to: put some cloth on bathtubbasin.
        Here are your current observations: Action: go to bathtubbasin 1
You arrive at bathtubbasin 1. On the bathtubbasin 1, you see nothing.


        The following actions are allowed: 
        1. go to a location
            :action GotoLocation
            :parameters (?from - location ?to - location)
        2. open an object/receptacle if it is closed
            :action OpenObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        3. close an object/receptacle
            :action CloseObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        4. take an object from another object/receptacle
            :action PickupObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        5. put object into/on/in another object/receptacle
            :action PutObject
            :parameters (?l - location ?o - object ?r - receptacle ?ot - otype ?rt - rtype)
        6. check inventory
        7. examine an object/receptacle
            :action examineReceptacle
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        8. using an object/receptacle by turning it on/off with a switch
        9. heat an object with another object/receptacle
            :action HeatObject
            :parameters (?l - location ?r - receptacle ?o - object)
        10. clean an object with another object/receptacle
            :action CleanObject
            :parameters (?l - location ?r - receptacle ?o - object)
        11. cool an object with another object/receptacle
            :action CoolObject
            :parameters (?l - location ?r - receptacle ?o - object)
        12. slice an object with another object/receptacle
            :action SliceObject
            :parameters (?l - location ?co - object ?ko - object)
        13. look around.

        You must go to a location in order to use it or take/put objects on it.

        The process involves two main stages:

        1. Searching for the Object:
            In this stage, your goal is to explore new, unvisited locations until you find the object mentioned in the task. You can only use the GotoLocation action to travel to a new location and the OpenObject action (if the location is closed) to verify whether it contains the target object.

            Goal 1.1: Reach a location that has not been visited (the location should be a receptacle) using the GotoLocation action. 
                You goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (at ?location)
                ) where location should be somewhere or some recepatacle not visited.

            Goal 1.2: If you already go to the recepatacle and found the recepatacle is closed, use the OpenObject action to open it and inspect the contents. 
                Your goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (opened ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be the recepatacle you want to open.

        2. Using the Object to Complete the Task:
            Once you have found the object, update your goal to focus on using it to complete the task.
            You need to first use the PickupObject action to take the object from a receptacle, then go to the aiming location by using GotoLocation action, and then put it into another receptacle.
            Or use it in some other way to complete the task.

        In summary, the first stage is all about finding the objectâ€”this might involve traveling to a location and opening it if necessary.
        
        Note, some receptacles have numbers in their names. Always keep them as they are. For example, "towelholder1" should not be changed to "towelholder".
        Your initial goal should always be to go to a new location instead of put something into somewhere.

                You goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (at ?location)
                ) where location should be somewhere or some recepatacle not visited.

            Goal 1.2: If you already go to the recepatacle and found the recepatacle is closed, use the OpenObject action to open it and inspect the contents. 
                Your goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (opened ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be the recepatacle you want to open.

        2. Using the Object to Complete the Task:
            Once you have found the object, update your goal to focus on using it to complete the task.
            You need to first use the PickupObject action to take the object from a receptacle, then go to the aiming location by using GotoLocation action, and then put it into another receptacle.
            Or use it in some other way to complete the task.

        In summary, the first stage is all about finding the objectâ€”this might involve traveling to a location and opening it if necessary.
        
        Note, some receptacles have numbers in their names. Always keep them as they are. For example, "towelholder1" should not be changed to "towelholder".
        Your initial goal should always be to go to a new location instead of put something into somewhere.

        You are in an environment that you must explore step by step. Your task is to build and update PDDL files for the environment using only your direct observations. Do not create or assume any objects, relationships, or details that have not been observed, and ensure you include all observations.

        The environment is a room containing various objects. Some of these objects are on, in, or contained within other objects and receptacles.
        
        Now, Your task is to: put some cloth on bathtubbasin.
        Here are your current observations: Action: go to cabinet 4
Nothing happens.


        The following actions are allowed: 
        1. go to a location
            :action GotoLocation
            :parameters (?from - location ?to - location)
        2. open an object/receptacle if it is closed
            :action OpenObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        3. close an object/receptacle
            :action CloseObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        4. take an object from another object/receptacle
            :action PickupObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        5. put object into/on/in another object/receptacle
            :action PutObject
            :parameters (?l - location ?o - object ?r - receptacle ?ot - otype ?rt - rtype)
        6. check inventory
        7. examine an object/receptacle
            :action examineReceptacle
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        8. using an object/receptacle by turning it on/off with a switch
        9. heat an object with another object/receptacle
            :action HeatObject
            :parameters (?l - location ?r - receptacle ?o - object)
        10. clean an object with another object/receptacle
            :action CleanObject
            :parameters (?l - location ?r - receptacle ?o - object)
        11. cool an object with another object/receptacle
            :action CoolObject
            :parameters (?l - location ?r - receptacle ?o - object)
        12. slice an object with another object/receptacle
            :action SliceObject
            :parameters (?l - location ?co - object ?ko - object)
        13. look around.

        You must go to a location in order to use it or take/put objects on it.

        The process involves two main stages:

        1. Searching for the Object:
            In this stage, your goal is to explore new, unvisited locations until you find the object mentioned in the task. You can only use the GotoLocation action to travel to a new location and the OpenObject action (if the location is closed) to verify whether it contains the target object.

            Goal 1.1: Reach a location that has not been visited (the location should be a receptacle) using the GotoLocation action. 
                You goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (at ?location)
                ) where location should be somewhere or some recepatacle not visited.

            Goal 1.2: If you already go to the recepatacle and found the recepatacle is closed, use the OpenObject action to open it and inspect the contents. 
                Your goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (opened ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be the recepatacle you want to open.

        2. Using the Object to Complete the Task:
            Once you have found the object, update your goal to focus on using it to complete the task.
            You need to first use the PickupObject action to take the object from a receptacle, then go to the aiming location by using GotoLocation action, and then put it into another receptacle.
            Or use it in some other way to complete the task.

        In summary, the first stage is all about finding the objectâ€”this might involve traveling to a location and opening it if necessary.
        
        Note, some receptacles have numbers in their names. Always keep them as they are. For example, "towelholder1" should not be changed to "towelholder".
        Your initial goal should always be to go to a new location instead of put something into somewhere.
