Prompt: 
        Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
        The format should strictly be:

            "pf": "..."

        You are in an environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
        Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations.
        You are in a room with different objects. Some objects are on/in other objects and receptacles. Your job is to compete the given task.

        The following actions are allowed: go to a location, open an object/receptacle, close an object/receptacle, take an object from another object/receptacle, put object into/on/in another object/receptacle, check inventory, examine an object/receptacle, using an object/receptacle by turning it on/off with a switch, heat an object with another object/receptacle, clean an object with another object/receptacle, cool an object with another object/receptacle, slice an object with another object/receptacle, and look around.

        You must go to a location in order to use it or take/put objects on it.

        Now, Your task is to: put some candle on countertop.
        Here are your current observations: Action: look around
You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you see a bathtubbasin 1, a countertop 2, a countertop 1, a drawer 4, a drawer 3, a drawer 2, a drawer 1, a garbagecan 1, a handtowelholder 1, a sinkbasin 1, a toilet 1, a toiletpaperhanger 1, a towelholder 2, and a towelholder 1.
