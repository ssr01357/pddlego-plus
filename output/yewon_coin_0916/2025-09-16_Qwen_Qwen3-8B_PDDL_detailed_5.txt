    You are in an environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
    Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
    Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
    Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
    In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
    If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.

This is previous problem file: 
(define (problem kitchen-problem)
  (:domain kitchen-domain)
  (:objects
   kitchen - location
   living_room - location
   north_room - location
   south_room - location
   west_room - location

   south - direction

   east - direction)
  (:init
   (at kitchen)
   (closed north)
   (closed south)
   (closed west)
   (open east)
   (connected kitchen north_room north)
   (connected kitchen south_room south)
   (connected kitchen west_room west)
   (connected kitchen living_room east))
  (:goal
   (at living_room)))


Now rewrite both the domain and problem files with the minimal fix.
