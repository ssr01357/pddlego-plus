    Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
    The format should strictly be:
        {
        "df": "...",
        "pf": "..."
        }

    You are in an environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
    Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
    Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
    Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
    In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
    If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
    Here are your current observations: Action: move west
Unknown action: I'm not sure what you mean.

    Here are some valid actions you can take: ['move east', 'move north', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to east', 'open door to north', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']
    You should generate df and pf strictly follow this valid actions. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:
    1. :action open-door
        :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
    2. :action move
        :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
    You should have a goal in the problem file like this: 
    (:goal 
        (at ?location)
    ) where ?location should be somewhere not visited, and must be ground (e.g., (at loc_2)), never (at ?l) or quantifiers.

    Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status

This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations: 
Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the South you see a closed plain door. To the West you see the corridor. 
Action: move west
You are in the corridor. To the North you see a closed wood door. To the South you see a closed sliding patio door. To the East you see the kitchen. To the West you see the living room. 
Action: move west
You are in the living room. To the North you see a closed wood door. To the East you see the corridor.

You are repeating the same sequence of actions for at least three times. You may stuck in one location or have the wrong goal.
You should revise your problem file to avoid the repeat.
Remember your goal is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet, i.e. your goal should be go to other not visited location but shouldn't be at one fixed location.

Now rewrite both the domain and problem files with the minimal fix.

    You are in an environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
    Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
    Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
    Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
    In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
    If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
    Here are your current observations: Action: move west

    Here are some valid actions you can take: ['move east', 'move north', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to east', 'open door to north', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']
    You should generate df and pf strictly follow this valid actions. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:

    2. :action move
        :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
    You should have a goal in the problem file like this: 
    (:goal 
        (at ?location)
    ) where ?location should be somewhere not visited, and must be ground (e.g., (at loc_2)), never (at ?l) or quantifiers.

    Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status

This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations:

You are in the kitchen. To the South you see a closed plain door. To the West you see the corridor.
