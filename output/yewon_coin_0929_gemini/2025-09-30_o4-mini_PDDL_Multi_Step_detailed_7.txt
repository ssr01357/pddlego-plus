You are in a partially observable environment. Your task is to generate a PDDL domain file ('df') based on the observations and valid actions.

Here are your current observations: Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see a closed wood door. To the East you see the corridor. To the West you see a closed plain door. 

Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to north', 'close door to west', 'move east', 'move north', 'move west', 'open door to north', 'open door to west']

You must generate a DF that strictly follows these action schemas. These are the only two actions allowed:
1. :action open-door
    :parameters (?loc - location ?dir - direction)
    ;; Description: Opens a door for discovery. Does not require knowing the destination.
2. :action move
    :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
    ;; Description: Moves between known connected locations.

The domain file MUST define the necessary predicates to support these actions, including:
- (at ?loc)
- (has-door ?loc ?dir)
- (door-is-closed ?loc ?dir)
- (door-is-open ?loc ?dir)
- (connected ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir)

The 'move' action precondition must ensure the connection is known (connected) AND the path is clear (the door is open, or no door exists).

Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to north', 'close door to west', 'move east', 'move north', 'move west', 'open door to north', 'open door to west']

Instructions for Initial State Definition:
Base the state ONLY on observations. Do not assume connections.

1. Handling Closed Doors: If you observe "a closed [type] door" to the [direction].
   -> Add (has-door ?loc ?dir) and (door-is-closed ?loc ?dir).
   -> CRITICAL: Do NOT add (connected ...) as the destination is unknown.
2. Handling Open Doors: If you observe "Through an open [type] door, to the [direction] you see the [New Room]".
   -> Add (has-door ?loc ?dir), (door-is-open ?loc ?dir).
   -> Add (connected ?loc ?new_room ?dir) AND the reverse connection.
3. Handling Open Passages: If you observe "To the [direction] you see the [New Room]" (no door mentioned).
   -> Add (connected ?loc ?new_room ?dir) and the reverse connection.
4. Handling Reveals: If the observation is a result of an action (e.g., "You open the door, revealing the [New Room]"), ensure the state reflects the *result* (door is now open) and the newly discovered connection.

Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status.

You are in a partially observable environment. Your output must be one single, complete PDDL problem file. To create it, add a `(:goal ...)` section to the provided objects and initial state, then wrap everything in the standard `(define (problem ...))` structure.

This is the domain file:

Here are your current observations: Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see a closed wood door. To the East you see the corridor. To the West you see a closed plain door. 

Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to north', 'close door to west', 'move east', 'move north', 'move west', 'open door to north', 'open door to west']

This is the objects and initial state of the problem file:
(:objects kitchen corridor - location north east west - direction)
(:init
  (at kitchen)
  (has-door kitchen north)
  (door-is-closed kitchen north)
  (connected kitchen corridor east)
  (connected corridor kitchen west)
  (has-door kitchen west)
  (door-is-closed kitchen west)
)

Goal Setting Strategy (Exploration):
Your task is always to explore. The goal must be grounded (no variables).

1. Priority 1: Information Gathering. If the initial state indicates there are closed doors at the agent's current location ((door-is-closed ?current_loc ?dir)), the goal MUST be to open one of them.
   Example: (:goal (door-is-open ?current_loc ?unexplored_dir))
   
2. Priority 2: Movement to Unvisited. If all paths from the current location are open and connections are known, the goal should be to move to an adjacent, unvisited location.
   Example: (:goal (at ?unvisited_location))

You open the wood door, revealing the bathroom. 

    Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to north', 'close door to west', 'move east', 'move north', 'move west', 'open door to north', 'open door to west']

    You must generate the DF and PF strictly following these action schemas:

    2. :action move

    Key Predicates (must be defined in DF and used in PF):
    - (at ?loc)
    - (has-door ?loc ?dir): A door exists at ?loc in ?dir.
    - (door-is-closed ?loc ?dir) / (door-is-open ?loc ?dir): State of the door.
    - (connected ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir): Connection knowledge discovered AFTER opening a door or observing an open passage.

    Exploration Strategy & State Representation:
    1. If you see a closed door, use (has-door) and (door-is-closed). Do NOT use (connected).
    2. When an action reveals a new location (e.g., "revealing the laundry room"), you MUST update the PF to include the new location object AND the (connected ...) facts for both directions.
    
    Goal Setting (Must be grounded, e.g., (at room_x), no variables or quantifiers):
    - Priority 1: Information Gathering. If there are closed doors at the current location, the goal should be to open one:
      (:goal (door-is-open ?current_loc ?unexplored_dir))
    - Priority 2: Movement. If paths are open and connections known, the goal should be to move to an unvisited location:
      (:goal (at ?unvisited_location))

    Here are your current observations: Action: open door to west
You open the plain door, revealing the pantry. 

    Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to north', 'close door to west', 'move east', 'move north', 'move west', 'open door to north', 'open door to west']

    You must generate the DF and PF strictly following these action schemas:
    1. :action open-door
        :parameters (?loc - location ?dir - direction)
        ;; Used for discovery. Does NOT require knowing the destination.
    2. :action move
        :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
        ;; Requires known connection and open path.

    Key Predicates (must be defined in DF and used in PF):
    - (at ?loc)
    - (has-door ?loc ?dir): A door exists at ?loc in ?dir.
    - (door-is-closed ?loc ?dir) / (door-is-open ?loc ?dir): State of the door.
    - (connected ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir): Connection knowledge discovered AFTER opening a door or observing an open passage.

    Exploration Strategy & State Representation:
    1. If you see a closed door, use (has-door) and (door-is-closed). Do NOT use (connected).
    2. When an action reveals a new location (e.g., "revealing the laundry room"), you MUST update the PF to include the new location object AND the (connected ...) facts for both directions.
    
    Goal Setting (Must be grounded, e.g., (at room_x), no variables or quantifiers):
    - Priority 1: Information Gathering. If there are closed doors at the current location, the goal should be to open one:
      (:goal (door-is-open ?current_loc ?unexplored_dir))
    - Priority 2: Movement. If paths are open and connections known, the goal should be to move to an unvisited location:
      (:goal (at ?unvisited_location))

    Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status.

This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations: 
Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see a closed wood door. To the East you see the corridor. To the West you see a closed plain door. 
Action: open door to north
You open the wood door, revealing the bathroom. 
Action: open door to west
You open the plain door, revealing the pantry. 

You have already generated df and pf files according to the observations.

You made some mistakes when generating those files. Here is the error message: 
ff: goal can be simplified to TRUE. The empty plan solves it

Now rewrite both the domain and problem files with the minimal fix.
