You are in a partially observable environment. Your task is to generate a PDDL domain file ('df') based on the observations and valid actions.

Here are your current observations: Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see the living room. To the South you see a closed wood door. To the East you see a closed frosted-glass door. To the West you see a closed sliding patio door. 

Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to east', 'close door to south', 'close door to west', 'move east', 'move north', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to east', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']

You must generate a DF that strictly follows these action schemas. These are the only two actions allowed:
1. :action open-door
    :parameters (?loc - location ?dir - direction)
    ;; Description: Opens a door for discovery. Does not require knowing the destination.
2. :action move
    :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
    ;; Description: Moves between known connected locations.

The domain file MUST define the necessary predicates to support these actions, including:
- (at ?loc)
- (has-door ?loc ?dir)
- (door-is-closed ?loc ?dir)
- (door-is-open ?loc ?dir)
- (connected ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir)

The 'move' action precondition must ensure the connection is known (connected) AND the path is clear (the door is open, or no door exists).

Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to east', 'close door to south', 'close door to west', 'move east', 'move north', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to east', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']

Instructions for Initial State Definition:
Base the state ONLY on observations. Do not assume connections.

1. Handling Closed Doors: If you observe "a closed [type] door" to the [direction].
   -> Add (has-door ?loc ?dir) and (door-is-closed ?loc ?dir).
   -> CRITICAL: Do NOT add (connected ...) as the destination is unknown.
2. Handling Open Doors: If you observe "Through an open [type] door, to the [direction] you see the [New Room]".
   -> Add (has-door ?loc ?dir), (door-is-open ?loc ?dir).
   -> Add (connected ?loc ?new_room ?dir) AND the reverse connection.
3. Handling Open Passages: If you observe "To the [direction] you see the [New Room]" (no door mentioned).
   -> Add (connected ?loc ?new_room ?dir) and the reverse connection.
4. Handling Reveals: If the observation is a result of an action (e.g., "You open the door, revealing the [New Room]"), ensure the state reflects the *result* (door is now open) and the newly discovered connection.

Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status.

You are in a partially observable environment. Your output must be one single, complete PDDL problem file. To create it, add a `(:goal ...)` section to the provided objects and initial state, then wrap everything in the standard `(define (problem ...))` structure.

This is the domain file:

Here are your current observations: Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see the living room. To the South you see a closed wood door. To the East you see a closed frosted-glass door. To the West you see a closed sliding patio door. 

Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to east', 'close door to south', 'close door to west', 'move east', 'move north', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to east', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']

This is the objects and initial state of the problem file:

Goal Setting Strategy (Exploration):
Your task is always to explore. The goal must be grounded (no variables).

1. Priority 1: Information Gathering. If the initial state indicates there are closed doors at the agent's current location ((door-is-closed ?current_loc ?dir)), the goal MUST be to open one of them.
   Example: (:goal (door-is-open ?current_loc ?unexplored_dir))
   
2. Priority 2: Movement to Unvisited. If all paths from the current location are open and connections are known, the goal should be to move to an adjacent, unvisited location.
   Example: (:goal (at ?unvisited_location))

    - (connected ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir): Connection knowledge discovered AFTER opening a door or observing an open passage.

    Exploration Strategy & State Representation:
    1. If you see a closed door, use (has-door) and (door-is-closed). Do NOT use (connected).
    2. When an action reveals a new location (e.g., "revealing the laundry room"), you MUST update the PF to include the new location object AND the (connected ...) facts for both directions.
    
    Goal Setting (Must be grounded, e.g., (at room_x), no variables or quantifiers):
    - Priority 1: Information Gathering. If there are closed doors at the current location, the goal should be to open one:

    2. :action move
        :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
        ;; Requires known connection and open path.

    Key Predicates (must be defined in DF and used in PF):
    - (at ?loc)
    - (has-door ?loc ?dir): A door exists at ?loc in ?dir.
    - (door-is-closed ?loc ?dir) / (door-is-open ?loc ?dir): State of the door.
    - (connected ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir): Connection knowledge discovered AFTER opening a door or observing an open passage.

    Exploration Strategy & State Representation:
    1. If you see a closed door, use (has-door) and (door-is-closed). Do NOT use (connected).
    2. When an action reveals a new location (e.g., "revealing the laundry room"), you MUST update the PF to include the new location object AND the (connected ...) facts for both directions.
    
    Goal Setting (Must be grounded, e.g., (at room_x), no variables or quantifiers):
    - Priority 1: Information Gathering. If there are closed doors at the current location, the goal should be to open one:
      (:goal (door-is-open ?current_loc ?unexplored_dir))
    - Priority 2: Movement. If paths are open and connections known, the goal should be to move to an unvisited location:
      (:goal (at ?unvisited_location))

    Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status.

This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations: 
Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see the living room. To the South you see a closed wood door. To the East you see a closed frosted-glass door. To the West you see a closed sliding patio door. 
Action: open door to south
You open the wood door, revealing the laundry room. 
Action: open door to east
You open the frosted-glass door, revealing the pantry. 
Action: open door to west
You open the sliding patio door, revealing the backyard.

Prompt: 
    Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
    The format should strictly be:
        {
        "df": "...",
        "pf": "..."
        }

    You are in a partially observable environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files based ONLY on your observations. 
    Do not invent information. Crucially, you do NOT know where a closed door leads until you open it.

    Here are your current observations: Action: move west
You are in the backyard. To the North you see a closed screen door. Through an open sliding patio door, to the East you see the kitchen. To the West you see the street. 

    Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to east', 'close door to north', 'move east', 'move north', 'move west', 'open door to east', 'open door to north']

    You must generate the DF and PF strictly following these action schemas:
    1. :action open-door
        :parameters (?loc - location ?dir - direction)
        ;; Used for discovery. Does NOT require knowing the destination.
    2. :action move
        :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
        ;; Requires known connection and open path.

    Key Predicates (must be defined in DF and used in PF):
    - (at ?loc)
    - (has-door ?loc ?dir): A door exists at ?loc in ?dir.
    - (door-is-closed ?loc ?dir) / (door-is-open ?loc ?dir): State of the door.
    - (connected ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir): Connection knowledge discovered AFTER opening a door or observing an open passage.

    Exploration Strategy & State Representation:
    1. If you see a closed door, use (has-door) and (door-is-closed). Do NOT use (connected).
    2. When an action reveals a new location (e.g., "revealing the laundry room"), you MUST update the PF to include the new location object AND the (connected ...) facts for both directions.
    
    Goal Setting (Must be grounded, e.g., (at room_x), no variables or quantifiers):
    - Priority 1: Information Gathering. If there are closed doors at the current location, the goal should be to open one:
      (:goal (door-is-open ?current_loc ?unexplored_dir))
    - Priority 2: Movement. If paths are open and connections known, the goal should be to move to an unvisited location:
      (:goal (at ?unvisited_location))

--Small Loop--: 0 
Prompt: 
    Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
    The format should strictly be:
        {
        "df": "...",
        "pf": "..."
        }

    You are in a partially observable environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files based ONLY on your observations. 
    Do not invent information. Crucially, you do NOT know where a closed door leads until you open it.

    Here are your current observations: Action: open door to north
You open the wood door, revealing the bathroom. 

    Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to north', 'close door to south', 'move east', 'move north', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to north', 'open door to south']

    You must generate the DF and PF strictly following these action schemas:
    1. :action open-door
        :parameters (?loc - location ?dir - direction)
        ;; Used for discovery. Does NOT require knowing the destination.
    2. :action move
        :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
        ;; Requires known connection and open path.

    Key Predicates (must be defined in DF and used in PF):
    - (at ?loc)
    - (has-door ?loc ?dir): A door exists at ?loc in ?dir.
    - (door-is-closed ?loc ?dir) / (door-is-open ?loc ?dir): State of the door.
    - (connected ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir): Connection knowledge discovered AFTER opening a door or observing an open passage.

    Exploration Strategy & State Representation:
    1. If you see a closed door, use (has-door) and (door-is-closed). Do NOT use (connected).
    2. When an action reveals a new location (e.g., "revealing the laundry room"), you MUST update the PF to include the new location object AND the (connected ...) facts for both directions.
    
    Goal Setting (Must be grounded, e.g., (at room_x), no variables or quantifiers):
    - Priority 1: Information Gathering. If there are closed doors at the current location, the goal should be to open one:
      (:goal (door-is-open ?current_loc ?unexplored_dir))
    - Priority 2: Movement. If paths are open and connections known, the goal should be to move to an unvisited location:
      (:goal (at ?unvisited_location))

    Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status.

This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations: 
Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see the living room. To the South you see a closed wood door. To the East you see a closed frosted-glass door. To the West you see a closed sliding patio door. 
Action: open door to south

Action: open door to east

Action: move west
You are in the backyard. To the North you see a closed screen door. Through an open sliding patio door, to the East you see the kitchen. To the West you see the street. 
Action: open door to north
You open the screen door, revealing the corridor.

--Small Loop--: 1 
Prompt: 
    Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
    The format should strictly be:
        {
        "df": "...",
        "pf": "..."
        }

    You are in a partially observable environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files based ONLY on your observations. 
    Do not invent information. Crucially, you do NOT know where a closed door leads until you open it.

    Here are your current observations: Action: move north
Unknown action: I'm not sure what you mean.

    Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to south', 'move south', 'open door to south']

    You must generate the DF and PF strictly following these action schemas:
    1. :action open-door
        :parameters (?loc - location ?dir - direction)
        ;; Used for discovery. Does NOT require knowing the destination.
    2. :action move
        :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
        ;; Requires known connection and open path.

    Key Predicates (must be defined in DF and used in PF):
    - (at ?loc)
    - (has-door ?loc ?dir): A door exists at ?loc in ?dir.
    - (door-is-closed ?loc ?dir) / (door-is-open ?loc ?dir): State of the door.
    - (connected ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir): Connection knowledge discovered AFTER opening a door or observing an open passage.

    Exploration Strategy & State Representation:
    1. If you see a closed door, use (has-door) and (door-is-closed). Do NOT use (connected).
    2. When an action reveals a new location (e.g., "revealing the laundry room"), you MUST update the PF to include the new location object AND the (connected ...) facts for both directions.
    
    Goal Setting (Must be grounded, e.g., (at room_x), no variables or quantifiers):
    - Priority 1: Information Gathering. If there are closed doors at the current location, the goal should be to open one:
      (:goal (door-is-open ?current_loc ?unexplored_dir))
    - Priority 2: Movement. If paths are open and connections known, the goal should be to move to an unvisited location:
      (:goal (at ?unvisited_location))

    Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status.

This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations: 
Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see the living room. To the South you see a closed wood door. To the East you see a closed frosted-glass door. To the West you see a closed sliding patio door. 
Action: open door to south
You open the wood door, revealing the laundry room. 
Action: open door to east
You open the frosted-glass door, revealing the pantry. 
Action: open door to west
You open the sliding patio door, revealing the backyard. 
Action: move west
You are in the backyard. To the North you see a closed screen door. Through an open sliding patio door, to the East you see the kitchen. To the West you see the street. 
Action: open door to north
You open the screen door, revealing the corridor. 
Action: move north
You are in the corridor. To the North you see a closed wood door. Through an open screen door, to the South you see the backyard. To the East you see the living room. To the West you see the driveway. 
Action: open door to north
You open the wood door, revealing the bathroom. 
Action: move north

You are in the living room. To the South you see the kitchen. To the East you see a closed wood door. To the West you see the corridor. 

    Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to east', 'move east', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to east']

    You must generate the DF and PF strictly following these action schemas:
    1. :action open-door
        :parameters (?loc - location ?dir - direction)
        ;; Used for discovery. Does NOT require knowing the destination.
    2. :action move
        :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
        ;; Requires known connection and open path.

    Key Predicates (must be defined in DF and used in PF):
    - (at ?loc)
    - (has-door ?loc ?dir): A door exists at ?loc in ?dir.
    - (door-is-closed ?loc ?dir) / (door-is-open ?loc ?dir): State of the door.
    - (connected ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir): Connection knowledge discovered AFTER opening a door or observing an open passage.

    Exploration Strategy & State Representation:
    1. If you see a closed door, use (has-door) and (door-is-closed). Do NOT use (connected).
    2. When an action reveals a new location (e.g., "revealing the laundry room"), you MUST update the PF to include the new location object AND the (connected ...) facts for both directions.
    
    Goal Setting (Must be grounded, e.g., (at room_x), no variables or quantifiers):
    - Priority 1: Information Gathering. If there are closed doors at the current location, the goal should be to open one:
      (:goal (door-is-open ?current_loc ?unexplored_dir))
    - Priority 2: Movement. If paths are open and connections known, the goal should be to move to an unvisited location:
      (:goal (at ?unvisited_location))

    Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status.

This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations:

    You are in a partially observable environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files based ONLY on your observations. 
    Do not invent information. Crucially, you do NOT know where a closed door leads until you open it.

    Here are your current observations: Action: move east
You are in the bedroom. Through an open wood door, to the West you see the living room. 

    Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to west', 'move west', 'open door to west']

    You must generate the DF and PF strictly following these action schemas:
    1. :action open-door
        :parameters (?loc - location ?dir - direction)
        ;; Used for discovery. Does NOT require knowing the destination.
    2. :action move
        :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
        ;; Requires known connection and open path.

    Key Predicates (must be defined in DF and used in PF):
    - (at ?loc)
    - (has-door ?loc ?dir): A door exists at ?loc in ?dir.
    - (door-is-closed ?loc ?dir) / (door-is-open ?loc ?dir): State of the door.
    - (connected ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir): Connection knowledge discovered AFTER opening a door or observing an open passage.

    Exploration Strategy & State Representation:
    1. If you see a closed door, use (has-door) and (door-is-closed). Do NOT use (connected).
    2. When an action reveals a new location (e.g., "revealing the laundry room"), you MUST update the PF to include the new location object AND the (connected ...) facts for both directions.
    
    Goal Setting (Must be grounded, e.g., (at room_x), no variables or quantifiers):
    - Priority 1: Information Gathering. If there are closed doors at the current location, the goal should be to open one:
      (:goal (door-is-open ?current_loc ?unexplored_dir))
    - Priority 2: Movement. If paths are open and connections known, the goal should be to move to an unvisited location:
      (:goal (at ?unvisited_location))

    Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status.

This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations:

    - Priority 1: Information Gathering. If there are closed doors at the current location, the goal should be to open one:
      (:goal (door-is-open ?current_loc ?unexplored_dir))
    - Priority 2: Movement. If paths are open and connections known, the goal should be to move to an unvisited location:

Prompt: 
    Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
    The format should strictly be:
        {
        "df": "...",
        "pf": "..."
        }

    You are in a partially observable environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files based ONLY on your observations. 
    Do not invent information. Crucially, you do NOT know where a closed door leads until you open it.

    Here are your current observations: Action: move west
You are in the living room. To the South you see the kitchen. Through an open wood door, to the East you see the bedroom. To the West you see the corridor. 

    Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to east', 'move east', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to east']

    You must generate the DF and PF strictly following these action schemas:
    1. :action open-door
        :parameters (?loc - location ?dir - direction)
        ;; Used for discovery. Does NOT require knowing the destination.
    2. :action move
        :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
        ;; Requires known connection and open path.

    Key Predicates (must be defined in DF and used in PF):
    - (at ?loc)
    - (has-door ?loc ?dir): A door exists at ?loc in ?dir.
    - (door-is-closed ?loc ?dir) / (door-is-open ?loc ?dir): State of the door.
    - (connected ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir): Connection knowledge discovered AFTER opening a door or observing an open passage.

    Exploration Strategy & State Representation:
    1. If you see a closed door, use (has-door) and (door-is-closed). Do NOT use (connected).
    2. When an action reveals a new location (e.g., "revealing the laundry room"), you MUST update the PF to include the new location object AND the (connected ...) facts for both directions.
    
    Goal Setting (Must be grounded, e.g., (at room_x), no variables or quantifiers):
    - Priority 1: Information Gathering. If there are closed doors at the current location, the goal should be to open one:
      (:goal (door-is-open ?current_loc ?unexplored_dir))
    - Priority 2: Movement. If paths are open and connections known, the goal should be to move to an unvisited location:
      (:goal (at ?unvisited_location))

Prompt: 
    Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
    The format should strictly be:
        {
        "df": "...",
        "pf": "..."
        }

    You are in a partially observable environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files based ONLY on your observations. 
    Do not invent information. Crucially, you do NOT know where a closed door leads until you open it.

    Here are your current observations: Action: move south
Unknown action: I'm not sure what you mean.

Action: move west
You can't move there, the door is closed. 

Action: move west
You can't move there, the door is closed. 

    Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to west', 'move east', 'move north', 'move west', 'open door to west']

    You must generate the DF and PF strictly following these action schemas:
    1. :action open-door
        :parameters (?loc - location ?dir - direction)
        ;; Used for discovery. Does NOT require knowing the destination.
    2. :action move
        :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
        ;; Requires known connection and open path.

    Key Predicates (must be defined in DF and used in PF):
    - (at ?loc)
    - (has-door ?loc ?dir): A door exists at ?loc in ?dir.
    - (door-is-closed ?loc ?dir) / (door-is-open ?loc ?dir): State of the door.
    - (connected ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir): Connection knowledge discovered AFTER opening a door or observing an open passage.

    Exploration Strategy & State Representation:
    1. If you see a closed door, use (has-door) and (door-is-closed). Do NOT use (connected).
    2. When an action reveals a new location (e.g., "revealing the laundry room"), you MUST update the PF to include the new location object AND the (connected ...) facts for both directions.
    
    Goal Setting (Must be grounded, e.g., (at room_x), no variables or quantifiers):
    - Priority 1: Information Gathering. If there are closed doors at the current location, the goal should be to open one:
      (:goal (door-is-open ?current_loc ?unexplored_dir))
    - Priority 2: Movement. If paths are open and connections known, the goal should be to move to an unvisited location:
      (:goal (at ?unvisited_location))

    Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status.

This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations:

Prompt: 
    Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
    The format should strictly be:
        {
        "df": "...",
        "pf": "..."
        }

    You are in a partially observable environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files based ONLY on your observations. 
    Do not invent information. Crucially, you do NOT know where a closed door leads until you open it.

    Here are your current observations: Action: open door to west
You open the commercial glass door, revealing the supermarket. 

    Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to west', 'move east', 'move north', 'move west', 'open door to west']

    You must generate the DF and PF strictly following these action schemas:
    1. :action open-door
        :parameters (?loc - location ?dir - direction)
        ;; Used for discovery. Does NOT require knowing the destination.
    2. :action move
        :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
        ;; Requires known connection and open path.

    Key Predicates (must be defined in DF and used in PF):
    - (at ?loc)
    - (has-door ?loc ?dir): A door exists at ?loc in ?dir.
    - (door-is-closed ?loc ?dir) / (door-is-open ?loc ?dir): State of the door.
    - (connected ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir): Connection knowledge discovered AFTER opening a door or observing an open passage.

    Exploration Strategy & State Representation:
    1. If you see a closed door, use (has-door) and (door-is-closed). Do NOT use (connected).
    2. When an action reveals a new location (e.g., "revealing the laundry room"), you MUST update the PF to include the new location object AND the (connected ...) facts for both directions.
    
    Goal Setting (Must be grounded, e.g., (at room_x), no variables or quantifiers):
    - Priority 1: Information Gathering. If there are closed doors at the current location, the goal should be to open one:
      (:goal (door-is-open ?current_loc ?unexplored_dir))
    - Priority 2: Movement. If paths are open and connections known, the goal should be to move to an unvisited location:
      (:goal (at ?unvisited_location))

    Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status.

This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations:

    Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to east', 'move east', 'open door to east']

    You must generate the DF and PF strictly following these action schemas:
    1. :action open-door
        :parameters (?loc - location ?dir - direction)
        ;; Used for discovery. Does NOT require knowing the destination.
    2. :action move
        :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
        ;; Requires known connection and open path.

    Key Predicates (must be defined in DF and used in PF):
    - (at ?loc)
    - (has-door ?loc ?dir): A door exists at ?loc in ?dir.
    - (door-is-closed ?loc ?dir) / (door-is-open ?loc ?dir): State of the door.
    - (connected ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir): Connection knowledge discovered AFTER opening a door or observing an open passage.

    Exploration Strategy & State Representation:
    1. If you see a closed door, use (has-door) and (door-is-closed). Do NOT use (connected).
    2. When an action reveals a new location (e.g., "revealing the laundry room"), you MUST update the PF to include the new location object AND the (connected ...) facts for both directions.
    
    Goal Setting (Must be grounded, e.g., (at room_x), no variables or quantifiers):
    - Priority 1: Information Gathering. If there are closed doors at the current location, the goal should be to open one:
      (:goal (door-is-open ?current_loc ?unexplored_dir))
    - Priority 2: Movement. If paths are open and connections known, the goal should be to move to an unvisited location:
      (:goal (at ?unvisited_location))

    Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status.

You are repeating the same sequence of actions for at least three times. You may stuck in one location or have the wrong goal.
You should revise your problem file to avoid the repeat.
Remember your goal is always to keep exploration: this means prioritizing opening closed doors (information gathering goal) or moving to unvisited known locations (movement goal). Ensure your goal reflects this intent.

You are repeating the same sequence of actions for at least three times. You may stuck in one location or have the wrong goal.
You should revise your problem file to avoid the repeat.
Remember your goal is always to keep exploration: this means prioritizing opening closed doors (information gathering goal) or moving to unvisited known locations (movement goal). Ensure your goal reflects this intent.

Now rewrite both the domain and problem files with the minimal fix.
