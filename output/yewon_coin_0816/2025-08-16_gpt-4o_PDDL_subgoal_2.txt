You are in an environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.

You are in an environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
Here are your current observations: Action: move east
You are in the kitchen. To the South you see a closed patio door. Through an open plain door, to the West you see the pantry. 

Action: open door to west

Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to south', 'close door to west', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to south', 'open door to west', 'take toaster']
You should generate df and pf strictly follow these valid actions. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:
1. :action open-door

Action: open door to west
You open the plain door, revealing the pantry. 
Action: move west

> move east 
 You are in the kitchen. In one part of the room you see a stove. There is also an oven. You also see a fridge that is closed. In another part of the room you see a counter that has a toaster on it. In one part of the room you see a kitchen cupboard that is closed. There is also a cutlery drawer that is closed. You also see a trash can that is closed. In another part of the room you see a dishwasher that is closed. In one part of the room you see a dining chair, that has nothing on it. 
To the South you see a closed patio door. Through an open plain door, to the West you see the pantry.

Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
The format should strictly be:
    {
    "df": "...",
    "pf": "..."
    }


You are in an environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
Here are your current observations: Action: move east
You are in the kitchen. To the South you see a closed patio door. Through an open plain door, to the West you see the pantry. 

Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to south', 'close door to west', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to south', 'open door to west', 'take toaster']
You should generate df and pf strictly follow these valid actions. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:
1. :action open-door
    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
2. :action move
    :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
You should have a goal in the problem file like this: 
(:goal 
    (at ?location)
) where location should be somewhere not visited
Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status


This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations: 
Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the South you see a closed patio door. To the West you see a closed plain door. 
Action: open door to west
You open the plain door, revealing the pantry. 
Action: move west
You are in the pantry. Through an open plain door, to the East you see the kitchen. 
Action: move east
You are in the kitchen. To the South you see a closed patio door. Through an open plain door, to the West you see the pantry. 


You have already generate df and pf files according to the observations.

You are repeating the same sequence of actions for at least three times. You may stuck in one location or have the wrong goal.
You should revise your problem file to avoid the repeat.
Remember your goal is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet, i.e. your goal should be go to other not visited location but shouldn't be at one fixed location.

Now rewrite both the domain and problem files with the minimal fix.

You are in an environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
Here are your current observations: Action: open door to west
That is already open. 

Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to south', 'close door to west', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to south', 'open door to west', 'take toaster']
You should generate df and pf strictly follow these valid actions. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:
1. :action open-door
    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
2. :action move
    :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
You should have a goal in the problem file like this: 
(:goal 
    (at ?location)
) where location should be somewhere not visited
Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status


This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations: 
Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the South you see a closed patio door. To the West you see a closed plain door. 
Action: open door to west
You open the plain door, revealing the pantry. 
Action: move west
You are in the pantry. Through an open plain door, to the East you see the kitchen. 
Action: move east
You are in the kitchen. To the South you see a closed patio door. Through an open plain door, to the West you see the pantry. 


You have already generate df and pf files according to the observations.

Based on the df and pf that you generated, the external solver could generate actions but after simulating in the game environment, it caused those errors: 
This is the action you take: open door to west. You try to open a door that is already open. You already visited here. Make sure the status of door is correct. 

You made some mistakes when generating those files. Here is the error message:

You are repeating the same sequence of actions for at least three times. You may stuck in one location or have the wrong goal.
You should revise your problem file to avoid the repeat.
Remember your goal is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet, i.e. your goal should be go to other not visited location but shouldn't be at one fixed location.

Now rewrite both the domain and problem files with the minimal fix.
