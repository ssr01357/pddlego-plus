        You should generate df and pf strictly follow this valid actions. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:
        1. :action open-door
            :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
        2. :action move
            :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
        You should have a goal in the problem file like this: 
        (:goal 
            (at ?location)
        ) where location should be somewhere not visited
        Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status
    
        This is previous domain file: (define (domain exploration)
  (:requirements :strips)
  (:predicates 
    (at ?loc - location)
    (door ?from ?to - location ?dir - direction)
    (closed ?from ?to - location ?dir - direction)
    (open ?from ?to - location ?dir - direction)
  )

  (:action open-door
    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
    :precondition (and (at ?loc1) (door ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir) (closed ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir))
    :effect (and (not (closed ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir)) (open ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir))
  )

  (:action move
    :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
    :precondition (and (at ?from) (door ?from ?to ?dir) (open ?from ?to ?dir))
    :effect (and (not (at ?from)) (at ?to))
  )
)
        This is previous problem file: (define (problem explore-problem)
  (:domain exploration)
  (:init
    (at kitchen)
    (door kitchen kitchen_south south)
    (closed kitchen kitchen_south south)
    (door kitchen kitchen_east east)
    (closed kitchen kitchen_east east)
  )
  (:goal (at kitchen_south))
)
        This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations: None
    
        You made some mistakes when generating those files. Here is the error message: None; 
        Now modify those two files according to the error message.
