You are in the kitchen. To the North you see a closed wood door. To the South you see a closed patio door. To the East you see the living room. To the West you see a closed frosted-glass door. 
Action: open door to north
You open the wood door, revealing the bathroom. 
Action: move north
You are in the bathroom. Through an open wood door, to the South you see the kitchen. To the West you see a closed wood door. 
Action: open door to west
You open the wood door, revealing the laundry room. 
Action: move west
You are in the laundry room. Through an open wood door, to the East you see the bathroom. To the West you see a closed wood door. 
Action: open door to west
You open the wood door, revealing the corridor.

        Now modify those two files according to the new observations and notes. Fix any errors you made in the previous setting according to the new observation.
        Generate updated files based on your new observation.
    
        You have already generate files according to the observations. The df and pf can generate actions but after simulating,
        it got those errors: This is the action you take: open door to west.                                             When you try to open door, there is no door here or there is nothing in this direction.                                            If there is no door, you can directly move to that direction.
. Please review both files and fix them.
        Now modify those two files according to the error message.
    
        You are repeating the same sequence of actions for at least three times. You may stuck in one location or have the wrong goal.
        You should revise your problem file to avoid the repeat.
        Remember your goal is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet, i.e. your goal should be go to other not visited location but shouldn't be at one fixed location.

        Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
        The format should strictly be:
            {
            "df": "...",
            "pf": "..."
            }
    
        You are in an environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
        Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
        Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
        Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
        In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
        If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
        Here are your current observations: Action: move east
You are in the laundry room. Through an open wood door, to the East you see the bathroom. Through an open wood door, to the West you see the corridor. 

Action: move east
You are in the bathroom. Through an open wood door, to the South you see the kitchen. Through an open wood door, to the West you see the laundry room. 

Action: move south
You are in the kitchen. Through an open wood door, to the North you see the bathroom. To the South you see a closed patio door. To the East you see the living room. To the West you see a closed frosted-glass door. 

Action: move east
You are in the living room. To the East you see a closed wood door. To the West you see the kitchen. 

        Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to south', 'close door to west', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']
        You should generate df and pf strictly follow this valid actions. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:
        1. :action open-door

        2. :action move
            :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
        You should have a goal in the problem file like this: 
        (:goal 
            (at ?location)
        ) where location should be somewhere not visited

        Here are your current observations: Action: move east
You can't move there, the door is closed. 

        Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to south', 'close door to west', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']
        You should generate df and pf strictly follow this valid actions. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:
        1. :action open-door
            :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
        2. :action move
            :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
        You should have a goal in the problem file like this: 
        (:goal 
            (at ?location)
        ) where location should be somewhere not visited
        Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status
    
        This is previous domain file: (define (domain explore-env)

  (:predicates

        This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations: Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see a closed wood door. To the South you see a closed patio door. To the East you see the living room. To the West you see a closed frosted-glass door. 
Action: open door to north
You open the wood door, revealing the bathroom.

        Now modify those two files according to the new observations and notes. Fix any errors you made in the previous setting according to the new observation.
        Generate updated files based on your new observation.
    
        You have already generate files according to the observations. The df and pf can generate actions but after simulating,
        it got those errors: This is the action you take: move east.                                         The door that you are moving to is closed.                                         You should first open door to that direction then move there!. Please review both files and fix them.
        Now modify those two files according to the error message.
