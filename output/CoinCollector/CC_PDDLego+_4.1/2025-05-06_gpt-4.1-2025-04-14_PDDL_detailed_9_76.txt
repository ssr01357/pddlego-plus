You are in the living room. Through an open wood door, to the South you see the bathroom. To the West you see a closed wood door. 

        Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to south', 'close door to west', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']
        You should generate df and pf strictly follow this valid actions. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:

        You should have a goal in the problem file like this:

        This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations: Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see a closed frosted-glass door. To the East you see a closed patio door. 
Action: open door to north
You open the frosted-glass door, revealing the pantry. 
Action: move north
You are in the pantry. Through an open frosted-glass door, to the South you see the kitchen. 
Action: move south
You are in the kitchen. Through an open frosted-glass door, to the North you see the pantry. To the East you see a closed patio door.

You open the patio door, revealing the backyard. 
Action: move east
You are in the backyard. To the North you see a closed screen door. To the East you see the driveway. Through an open patio door, to the West you see the kitchen. 
Action: open door to north
You open the screen door, revealing the corridor. 
Action: move north
You are in the corridor. To the North you see a closed wood door. Through an open screen door, to the South you see the backyard. To the East you see a closed wood door. 
Action: open door to north
You open the wood door, revealing the bathroom.

Action: move north
You are in the living room. Through an open wood door, to the South you see the bathroom. To the West you see a closed wood door. 

    
        Now modify those two files according to the new observations and notes. Fix any errors you made in the previous setting according to the new observation.
        Generate updated files based on your new observation.
    
        You are repeating the same sequence of actions for at least three times. You may stuck in one location or have the wrong goal.
        You should revise your problem file to avoid the repeat.
        Remember your goal is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet, i.e. your goal should be go to other not visited location but shouldn't be at one fixed location.

        You should have a goal in the problem file like this: 
        (:goal 
            (at ?location)
        ) where location should be somewhere not visited
        Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status

        You made some mistakes when generating those files. Here is the error message: None; 
        Now modify those two files according to the error message.
    
        You are repeating the same sequence of actions for at least three times. You may stuck in one location or have the wrong goal.
