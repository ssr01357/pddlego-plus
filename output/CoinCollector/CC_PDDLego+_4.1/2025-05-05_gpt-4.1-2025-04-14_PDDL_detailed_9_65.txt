        Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
        Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
        In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.

        You are in an environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
        Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
        Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
        Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
        In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
        If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
        Here are your current observations: Action: move south
You are in the corridor. Through an open wood door, to the North you see the laundry room. To the South you see the kitchen. To the East you see a closed wood door. To the West you see a closed patio door. 

Action: open door to east
You open the wood door, revealing the bathroom. 

Action: move east
You are in the bathroom. To the North you see a closed wood door. Through an open wood door, to the West you see the corridor. 

        Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to south', 'close door to west', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']
        You should generate df and pf strictly follow this valid actions. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:
        1. :action open-door
            :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
        2. :action move
            :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
        You should have a goal in the problem file like this: 
        (:goal 
            (at ?location)
        ) where location should be somewhere not visited
        Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status

        This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations: Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see the corridor. To the South you see a closed frosted-glass door. 
Action: open door to south
You open the frosted-glass door, revealing the pantry. 
Action: move south
You are in the pantry. Through an open frosted-glass door, to the North you see the kitchen. 
Action: move north
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see the corridor. Through an open frosted-glass door, to the South you see the pantry. 
Action: move north
You are in the corridor. To the North you see a closed wood door. To the South you see the kitchen. To the East you see a closed wood door. To the West you see a closed patio door. 
Action: open door to north
You open the wood door, revealing the laundry room. 
Action: move north
You are in the laundry room. Through an open wood door, to the South you see the corridor. 
Action: move south
You are in the corridor. Through an open wood door, to the North you see the laundry room. To the South you see the kitchen. To the East you see a closed wood door. To the West you see a closed patio door. 
Action: open door to east
You open the wood door, revealing the bathroom. 
Action: move east
You are in the bathroom. To the North you see a closed wood door. Through an open wood door, to the West you see the corridor. 

    
        Now modify those two files according to the new observations and notes. Fix any errors you made in the previous setting according to the new observation.
        Generate updated files based on your new observation.
