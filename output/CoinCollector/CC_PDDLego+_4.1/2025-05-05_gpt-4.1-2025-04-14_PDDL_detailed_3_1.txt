        This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations: Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the East you see a closed plain door. To the West you see the corridor. 
Action: open door to east
You open the plain door, revealing the pantry. 
Action: move east
You are in the pantry. Through an open plain door, to the West you see the kitchen. 
Action: move west
You are in the kitchen. Through an open plain door, to the East you see the pantry. To the West you see the corridor. 

    
        Now modify those two files according to the new observations and notes. Fix any errors you made in the previous setting according to the new observation.
        Generate updated files based on your new observation.
