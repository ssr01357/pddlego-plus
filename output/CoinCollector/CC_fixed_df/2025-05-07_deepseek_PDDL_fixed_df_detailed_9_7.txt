        Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. The domain file is fixed and will be provided below. It should not be modified.
        The format should strictly be:
            {
            "pf": "..."
            }

        You are in an environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
        Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
        Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
        Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
        In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
        If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.

You are in the corridor. Through an open wood door, to the North you see the laundry room. To the South you see the driveway. To the East you see a closed patio door. To the West you see the kitchen. 

Action: open door to east
You open the patio door, revealing the backyard. 

Action: move east
You are in the backyard. To the East you see a closed patio door. Through an open patio door, to the West you see the corridor. 

        Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to south', 'close door to west', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']

Prompt: 
        Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. The domain file is fixed and will be provided below. It should not be modified.
        The format should strictly be:
            {
            "pf": "..."
            }

        You are in an environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
        Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
        Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
        Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
        In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
        If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
        Here are your current observations: Action: move south
You are in the kitchen. Through an open plain door, to the North you see the pantry. To the South you see a closed wood door. To the East you see the corridor. 

Action: open door to south
You open the wood door, revealing the bathroom. 

Action: move south
You are in the bathroom. Through an open wood door, to the North you see the kitchen. 

        Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to south', 'close door to west', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']
        You should have a goal in the problem file like this: 
        (:goal 
            (at ?location)
        ) where location should be somewhere not visited
        Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status

        This is the fixed domain file and you should not modify it: 
        (define (domain exploration)
  (:requirements :strips)
  (:types location direction)
  (:predicates
    (at ?loc - location)
    (connected ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)

                 (door-open ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir)
