        If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
        Here are your current observations: Action: move north
You are in the corridor. To the North you see a closed wood door. To the South you see the driveway. To the East you see a closed patio door. To the West you see the kitchen. 

Action: open door to east
You open the patio door, revealing the backyard. 

Action: move east
You are in the backyard. To the East you see a closed patio door. Through an open patio door, to the West you see the corridor. 

        Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to south', 'close door to west', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']
        You should have a goal in the problem file like this: 
        (:goal 
            (at ?location)
        ) where location should be somewhere not visited
        Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status

        This is the fixed domain file and you should not modify it: 
        (define (domain exploration)
  (:requirements :strips :typing)
  (:types location direction)
  (:predicates
    (at ?l - location)
    (door-open ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
    (door-closed ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
    (connected ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
  )

  (:action open-door
    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
    :precondition (and (at ?loc1) (door-closed ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir))
    :effect (and (not (door-closed ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir)) (door-open ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir))
  )

  (:action move
    :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
    :precondition (and (at ?from) (or (door-open ?from ?to ?dir) (connected ?from ?to ?dir)))
    :effect (and (not (at ?from)) (at ?to))
  )
)
    
        This is previous problem file: (define (problem prob1)
  (:domain exploration)
  (:objects
    kitchen corridor driveway room_north room_south room_north_corridor room_east_corridor - location
    north south east west - direction

  (:init

        This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations: Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see a closed plain door. To the South you see a closed wood door. To the East you see the corridor. 
Action: move east
You are in the corridor. To the North you see a closed wood door. To the South you see the driveway. To the East you see a closed patio door. To the West you see the kitchen. 
Action: move south
You are in the driveway. To the North you see the corridor. 
Action: move north
You are in the corridor. To the North you see a closed wood door. To the South you see the driveway. To the East you see a closed patio door. To the West you see the kitchen. 
Action: open door to east
You open the patio door, revealing the backyard. 
Action: move east
You are in the backyard. To the East you see a closed patio door. Through an open patio door, to the West you see the corridor. 

    
        Now modify those two files according to the new observations and notes. Fix any errors you made in the previous setting according to the new observation.
        Generate updated files based on your new observation.
