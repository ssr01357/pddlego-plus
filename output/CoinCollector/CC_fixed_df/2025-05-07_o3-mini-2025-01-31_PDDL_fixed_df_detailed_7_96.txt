Prompt: 
        Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. The domain file is fixed and will be provided below. It should not be modified.
        The format should strictly be:
            {
            "pf": "..."
            }

        You are in an environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
        Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
        Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
        Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
        In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
        If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
        Here are your current observations: Action: move east
You are in the kitchen. Through an open wood door, to the South you see the bathroom. Through an open sliding patio door, to the East you see the backyard. Through an open frosted-glass door, to the West you see the pantry. 

Action: move east
You are in the backyard. Through an open patio door, to the South you see the corridor. To the East you see a closed screen door. Through an open sliding patio door, to the West you see the kitchen. 

Action: open door to east
You open the screen door, revealing the living room. 

Action: move east
You are in the living room. To the East you see a closed wood door. Through an open screen door, to the West you see the backyard. 

        Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to south', 'close door to west', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']
        You should have a goal in the problem file like this: 
        (:goal 
            (at ?location)
        ) where location should be somewhere not visited
        Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status

        This is the fixed domain file and you should not modify it:
