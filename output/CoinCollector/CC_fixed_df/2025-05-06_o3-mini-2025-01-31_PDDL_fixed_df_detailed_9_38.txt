        Here are your current observations: Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see a closed wood door. To the South you see a closed plain door. To the East you see the corridor. To the West you see the living room. 

        Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to south', 'close door to west', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']
        You should have a goal in the problem file like this: 
        (:goal 
            (at ?location)
        ) where location should be somewhere not visited
        Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status

        This is the fixed domain file and you should not modify it: 
        (define (domain exploration)
  (:requirements :strips :typing)
  (:types location direction)
  (:predicates
    (at ?loc - location)
    (connected ?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
    (door ?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
    (open ?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
  )
  (:action open-door
    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
    :precondition (and (at ?loc1) (door ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir) (not (open ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir)))
    :effect (open ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir)
  )
  (:action move
    :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
    :precondition (and (at ?from) (connected ?from ?to ?dir) (or (not (door ?from ?to ?dir)) (open ?from ?to ?dir)))
    :effect (and (not (at ?from)) (at ?to))
  )
)
    
        This is previous problem file: (define (problem exploration1)
  (:domain exploration)
  (:init
    ; Current location
    (at kitchen)

    ; Observed free connection: kitchen to corridor (east)
    (connected kitchen corridor east)
    (connected corridor kitchen west)

    ; Observed connection: west door to living_room; door exists but is closed
    (connected kitchen living_room west)
    (connected living_room kitchen east)
    (door kitchen living_room west)

    ; Observed connection: north closed wood door; room behind is north_room
    (connected kitchen north_room north)
    (connected north_room kitchen south)
    (door kitchen north_room north)

    ; Observed connection: south closed plain door; room behind is south_room
    (connected kitchen south_room south)
    (connected south_room kitchen north)
    (door kitchen south_room south)
  )
