        Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
        In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
        If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
        Here are your current observations: Action: move south
You are in the corridor. Through an open wood door, to the North you see the bathroom. To the South you see a closed wood door. To the East you see the kitchen. To the West you see a closed patio door. 

Action: move east
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see a closed wood door. To the East you see a closed frosted-glass door. To the West you see the corridor. 

Action: open door to north
You open the wood door, revealing the laundry room. 

Action: move north
You are in the laundry room. Through an open wood door, to the South you see the kitchen. To the West you see a closed wood door. 

        Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to south', 'close door to west', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']
        You should have a goal in the problem file like this:

        You are in an environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
        Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
        Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
        Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
        In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.

        You are in an environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
        Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
        Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
        Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
        In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
        If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.

Action: move west
You are in the street. To the East you see the backyard. To the West you see a closed sliding door. 

        Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to south', 'close door to west', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']
