        This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations: Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see a closed plain door. To the West you see the corridor. 
Action: move west
You are in the corridor. To the North you see a closed sliding patio door. To the South you see a closed wood door. To the East you see the kitchen. To the West you see a closed wood door. 
Action: open door to north
You open the sliding patio door, revealing the backyard. 
Action: move north
You are in the backyard. Through an open sliding patio door, to the South you see the corridor. 

    
        Now modify those two files according to the new observations and notes. Fix any errors you made in the previous setting according to the new observation.
        Generate updated files based on your new observation.
    
        You have already generate files according to the observations. The df and pf can generate actions but after simulating,
        it got those errors: This is the action you take: open door to south.                                             You try to open a door that is already open. You already visited here. Make sure the status of door is correct.. Please review both files and fix them.

        Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. The domain file is fixed and will be provided below. It should not be modified.
        The format should strictly be:
            {
            "pf": "..."
            }

        You are in an environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
        Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
        Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
        Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
        In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
        If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
        Here are your current observations: Action: move south
You are in the corridor. Through an open sliding patio door, to the North you see the backyard. To the South you see a closed wood door. To the East you see the kitchen. To the West you see a closed wood door. 

Action: open door to west
You open the wood door, revealing the bathroom. 

Action: move west
You are in the bathroom. To the South you see a closed wood door. Through an open wood door, to the East you see the corridor. 

        Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to south', 'close door to west', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']
        You should have a goal in the problem file like this: 
        (:goal
