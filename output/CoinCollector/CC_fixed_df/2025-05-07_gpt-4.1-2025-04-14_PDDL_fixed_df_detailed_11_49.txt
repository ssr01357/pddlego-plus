        Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
        Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
        In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.

        Here are your current observations: Action: open door to east
You open the wood door, revealing the laundry room. 

Action: move east
You are in the laundry room. To the South you see a closed wood door. Through an open wood door, to the West you see the bathroom. 

        Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to south', 'close door to west', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']
        You should have a goal in the problem file like this:

        You are in an environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
        Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
        Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
        Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
        In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
        If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
        Here are your current observations: Action: move west
You are in the kitchen. Through an open wood door, to the North you see the laundry room. Through an open frosted-glass door, to the East you see the pantry. To the West you see the corridor. 

Action: move west
You are in the corridor. Through an open wood door, to the North you see the bathroom. To the South you see a closed wood door. To the East you see the kitchen. To the West you see a closed patio door. 

Action: open door to west
You open the patio door, revealing the backyard. 

Action: move west
You are in the backyard. To the North you see the driveway. To the South you see a closed screen door. Through an open patio door, to the East you see the corridor. To the West you see the street. 

        Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to south', 'close door to west', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']
        You should have a goal in the problem file like this: 
        (:goal 
            (at ?location)
        ) where location should be somewhere not visited

        Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. The domain file is fixed and will be provided below. It should not be modified.
        The format should strictly be:

        You are in an environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
        Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
        Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
        Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
        In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
        If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
        Here are your current observations: Action: move west
You are in the kitchen. Through an open wood door, to the North you see the laundry room. Through an open frosted-glass door, to the East you see the pantry. To the West you see the corridor. 

Action: move west
You are in the corridor. Through an open wood door, to the North you see the bathroom. To the South you see a closed wood door. To the East you see the kitchen. To the West you see a closed patio door. 

Action: open door to west
You open the patio door, revealing the backyard. 

Action: move west
You are in the backyard. To the North you see the driveway. To the South you see a closed screen door. Through an open patio door, to the East you see the corridor. To the West you see the street. 

        Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to south', 'close door to west', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']
        You should have a goal in the problem file like this:
