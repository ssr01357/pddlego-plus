        In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
        If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
        Here are your current observations: Action: open door to east
You open the wood door, revealing the bathroom. 

Action: move east
You are in the bathroom. To the South you see a closed wood door. Through an open wood door, to the West you see the laundry room. 

        Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to south', 'close door to west', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']
        You should have a goal in the problem file like this: 
        (:goal 
            (at ?location)
        ) where location should be somewhere not visited
        Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status

        This is the fixed domain file and you should not modify it: 
        (define (domain exploration)
  (:requirements :typing)
  (:types location direction)
  (:predicates
    (at ?loc - location)
    (connected ?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
    (door-closed ?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
  )

  (:action open-door
    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
    :precondition (door-closed ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir)
    :effect (not (door-closed ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir))
  )

  (:action move
    :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
    :precondition (and (at ?from) (connected ?from ?to ?dir) (not (door-closed ?from ?to ?dir)))
    :effect (and (not (at ?from)) (at ?to))
  )
) 
    
        This is previous problem file: (define (problem explore4)
