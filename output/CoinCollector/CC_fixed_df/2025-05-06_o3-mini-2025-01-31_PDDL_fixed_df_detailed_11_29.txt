You are in the street. To the East you see the backyard. To the West you see a closed sliding door. 

        Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to south', 'close door to west', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']
        You should have a goal in the problem file like this: 
        (:goal 
            (at ?location)
        ) where location should be somewhere not visited
        Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status

        This is the fixed domain file and you should not modify it: 
        (define (domain explore)
  (:requirements :strips :typing :negative-preconditions)
  (:types location direction)
  (:predicates
    (at ?l - location)
    (connected ?l1 - location ?l2 - location ?d - direction)
    (door-closed ?l1 - location ?l2 - location ?d - direction)
  )

  (:action open-door
    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
    :precondition (and (at ?loc1) (connected ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir) (door-closed ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir))
    :effect (not (door-closed ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir))
  )

  (:action move
    :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
    :precondition (and (at ?from) (connected ?from ?to ?dir) (not (door-closed ?from ?to ?dir)))
    :effect (and (at ?to) (not (at ?from)))
  )
)
