        You have already generate files according to the observations. The df and pf can generate actions but after simulating,
        it got those errors: This is the action you take: open door to w.                                                 When you try to open door, there is no door here or there is nothing in this direction.                                                If there is no door, you can directly move to that direction.
. Please review both files and fix them.
        Now modify those two files according to the error message.
