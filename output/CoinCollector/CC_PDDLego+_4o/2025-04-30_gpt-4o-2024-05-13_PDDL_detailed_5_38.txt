        This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations: Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see the corridor. To the East you see a closed plain door. To the West you see a closed sliding patio door. 
Action: open door to east
You open the plain door, revealing the pantry. 
Action: move east
You are in the pantry. Through an open plain door, to the West you see the kitchen.

You are in the kitchen. To the North you see the corridor. Through an open plain door, to the East you see the pantry. To the West you see a closed sliding patio door. 

    
        Now modify those two files according to the new observations and notes. Fix any errors you made in the previous setting according to the new observation.
        Generate updated files based on your new observation.
    
        You have already generate files according to the observations. The df and pf can generate actions but after simulating,
        it got those errors: This is the action you take: move west.                                         The door that you are moving to is closed.                                         You should first open door to that direction then move there!. Please review both files and fix them.
        Now modify those two files according to the error message.
