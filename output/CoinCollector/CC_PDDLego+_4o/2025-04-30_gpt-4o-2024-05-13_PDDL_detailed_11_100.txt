        You should generate df and pf strictly follow this valid actions. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:
        1. :action open-door
            :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
        2. :action move
            :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
        You should have a goal in the problem file like this: 
        (:goal 
            (at ?location)
        ) where location should be somewhere not visited
        Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status
    
        This is previous domain file: (define (domain explore)
  (:requirements :strips :typing)
  (:types location door direction)
  (:predicates
    (at ?loc - location)
    (door ?d - door ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
    (open ?d - door)
  )
  (:action open-door
    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
    :precondition (door ?d ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir)
    :effect (open ?d)
  )
  (:action move
    :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
    :precondition (and (at ?from) (open ?d) (door ?d ?from ?to ?dir))
    :effect (and (at ?to) (not (at ?from)))
  )
)
        This is previous problem file: (define (problem explore-kitchen)
  (:domain explore)
  (:objects
    kitchen living_room corridor unknown_room1 unknown_room2 - location
    wood_door frosted_glass_door - door
    north south east west - direction
  )
  (:init
    (at kitchen)
    (door wood_door kitchen unknown_room1 south)
    (door frosted_glass_door kitchen unknown_room2 east)
    (door corridor kitchen living_room west)
  )
  (:goal (at unknown_room1))
)
        This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations: None
    
        You made some mistakes when generating those files. Here is the error message: None; 
        Now modify those two files according to the error message.
