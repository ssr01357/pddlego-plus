You open the frosted-glass door, revealing the pantry. 
Action: move west
You are in the pantry. Through an open frosted-glass door, to the East you see the kitchen. 

    
        Now modify those two files according to the new observations and notes. Fix any errors you made in the previous setting according to the new observation.
        Generate updated files based on your new observation.
    
        You have already generate files according to the observations. The df and pf can generate actions but after simulating,
        it got those errors: This is the action you take: open door to east.                                         You try to open a door that is already open. You already visited here. Make sure the status of door is correct.. Please review both files and fix them.
        Now modify those two files according to the error message.
    
        You are repeating the same sequence of actions for at least three times. You may stuck in one location or have the wrong goal.
        You should revise your problem file to avoid the repeat.
        Remember your goal is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet, i.e. your goal should be go to other not visited location but shouldn't be at one fixed location.

Prompt: 
        Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
        The format should strictly be:
            {
            "df": "...",
            "pf": "..."
            }
    
        You are in an environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
        Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
        Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
        Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
        In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
        If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
        Here are your current observations: Action: open door to east
That is already open. 

        Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to south', 'close door to west', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']
        You should generate df and pf strictly follow this valid actions. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:
        1. :action open-door
            :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
        2. :action move
            :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
        You should have a goal in the problem file like this: 
        (:goal 
            (at ?location)
        ) where location should be somewhere not visited
        Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status
    
        This is previous domain file: (define (domain house-exploration) (:requirements :strips :typing) (:types location direction) (:predicates (at ?loc - location) (door-closed ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location) (connected ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)) (:action open-door :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction) :precondition (door-closed ?loc1 ?loc2) :effect (not (door-closed ?loc1 ?loc2))) (:action move :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction) :precondition (and (at ?from) (connected ?from ?to ?dir) (not (door-closed ?from ?to))) :effect (and (at ?to) (not (at ?from)))))
        This is previous problem file: (define (problem explore-house) (:domain house-exploration) (:objects kitchen - location patio-door - location frosted-glass-door - location pantry - location south west east - direction) (:init (at pantry) (connected kitchen patio-door south) (connected kitchen frosted-glass-door west) (connected kitchen pantry west) (connected pantry kitchen east) (door-closed kitchen patio-door)) (:goal (at patio-door)))
        This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations: Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the South you see a closed sliding patio door. To the West you see a closed frosted-glass door. 
Action: open door to west
You open the frosted-glass door, revealing the pantry. 
Action: move west
You are in the pantry. Through an open frosted-glass door, to the East you see the kitchen.
