Observations: You are in the kitchen. In one part of the room you see a stove. There is also an oven. You also see a fridge that is closed. In another part of the room you see a counter, that has nothing on it. In one part of the room you see a kitchen cupboard that is closed. There is also a cutlery drawer that is closed. You also see a trash can that is closed. In another part of the room you see a dishwasher that is closed. In one part of the room you see a dining chair, that has nothing on it. There is also a coin. 
To the South you see the corridor. To the East you see a closed frosted-glass door.  
Gold path: ['look around', 'take coin'] 
Valid Actions: ['inventory', 'look around', 'move east', 'move south', 'take coin', 'open door to east', 'close door to east'] 
taskDescription: Your task is to search the environment and find the coin.  Once you find the coin, take it. 
brief_obs: Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the South you see the corridor. To the East you see a closed frosted-glass door.

        Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
        Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
        In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
