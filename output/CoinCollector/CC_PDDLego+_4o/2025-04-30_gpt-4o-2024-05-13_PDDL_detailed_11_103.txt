You are in the kitchen. To the North you see the corridor. To the South you see a closed plain door. To the East you see a closed patio door. To the West you see a closed wood door. 
Action: open door to east
You open the patio door, revealing the backyard. 
Action: move east
You are in the backyard. To the North you see the driveway. To the East you see the street. Through an open patio door, to the West you see the kitchen. 

    
        Now modify those two files according to the new observations and notes. Fix any errors you made in the previous setting according to the new observation.
        Generate updated files based on your new observation.
    
        You have already generate files according to the observations. The df and pf can generate actions but after simulating,
        it got those errors: This is the action you take: open door to north.                                             When you try to open door, there is no door here or there is nothing in this direction.                                            If there is no door, you can directly move to that direction.
. Please review both files and fix them.
        Now modify those two files according to the error message.

You are in the laundry room. To the South you see a closed wood door. Through an open wood door, to the East you see the corridor. 

        Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to south', 'close door to west', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']
        You should generate df and pf strictly follow this valid actions. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:
        1. :action open-door
            :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
        2. :action move
            :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
        You should have a goal in the problem file like this: 
        (:goal 
            (at ?location)
        ) where location should be somewhere not visited
        Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status
