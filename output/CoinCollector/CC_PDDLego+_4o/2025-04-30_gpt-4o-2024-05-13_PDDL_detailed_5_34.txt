Observations: You are in the kitchen. In one part of the room you see a stove. There is also an oven. You also see a fridge that is closed. In another part of the room you see a counter, that has nothing on it. In one part of the room you see a kitchen cupboard that is closed. There is also a cutlery drawer that is closed. You also see a trash can that is closed. In another part of the room you see a dishwasher that is closed. In one part of the room you see a dining chair, that has nothing on it. There is also a coin. 
To the North you see the corridor. To the West you see a closed frosted-glass door.  
Gold path: ['look around', 'take coin'] 
Valid Actions: ['inventory', 'look around', 'move west', 'move north', 'take coin', 'open door to west', 'close door to west'] 
taskDescription: Your task is to search the environment and find the coin.  Once you find the coin, take it. 
brief_obs: Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see the corridor. To the West you see a closed frosted-glass door.

        Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
        The format should strictly be:

            "df": "...",
            "pf": "..."
            }
    
        You are in an environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
        Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
        Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
        Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
        In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
        If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
        Here are your current observations: Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see the corridor. To the West you see a closed frosted-glass door. 

        Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to south', 'close door to west', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']
        You should generate df and pf strictly follow this valid actions. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:

        2. :action move

        You should have a goal in the problem file like this: 
        (:goal 
            (at ?location)

You are in the pantry. Through an open frosted-glass door, to the East you see the kitchen. 

        Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to south', 'close door to west', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']
        You should generate df and pf strictly follow this valid actions. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:
        1. :action open-door
            :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
        2. :action move
            :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
        You should have a goal in the problem file like this: 
        (:goal 
            (at ?location)
        ) where location should be somewhere not visited
        Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status
    
        This is previous domain file: (define (domain house)
  (:requirements :strips :typing)
  (:types location direction)

  (:predicates
    (at ?loc - location)
    (connected ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
    (door-closed ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
    (door-open ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
  )

  (:action open-door
    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
    :precondition (and
      (door-closed ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir)
      (at ?loc1)
    )
    :effect (and
      (door-open ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir)
      (not (door-closed ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir))
    )
  )

  (:action move
    :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
    :precondition (and
      (at ?from)
      (connected ?from ?to ?dir)
      (door-open ?from ?to ?dir)
    )
    :effect (and
      (at ?to)
      (not (at ?from))
    )
  )
)
        This is previous problem file: (define (problem explore-house)
  (:domain house)
  (:objects
    kitchen pantry corridor - location
    north east west - direction
  )
  (:init
    (at pantry)
    (connected kitchen pantry west)
    (connected pantry kitchen east)
    (connected kitchen corridor north)
    (door-open kitchen pantry west)
    (door-closed kitchen corridor north)
  )
  (:goal
    (at corridor)
  )
)
        This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations: Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see the corridor. To the West you see a closed frosted-glass door. 
Action: open door to west
You open the frosted-glass door, revealing the pantry. 
Action: move west
You are in the pantry. Through an open frosted-glass door, to the East you see the kitchen. 

    
        You made some mistakes when generating those files. Here is the error message: None; 
        Now modify those two files according to the error message.
