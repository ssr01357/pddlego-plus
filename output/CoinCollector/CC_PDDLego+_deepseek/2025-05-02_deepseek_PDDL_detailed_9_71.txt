        This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations: Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see a closed sliding patio door. To the East you see a closed plain door. To the West you see the corridor. 
Action: move west
You are in the corridor. To the North you see a closed wood door. To the South you see a closed wood door. To the East you see the kitchen. To the West you see the driveway. 
Action: move west
You are in the driveway. To the East you see the corridor. 

    
        You made some mistakes when generating those files. Here is the error message: None; 
problem: syntax error in line 28, '':
'define' expected

        Now modify those two files according to the error message.
    
        You are repeating the same sequence of actions for at least three times. You may stuck in one location or have the wrong goal.
        You should revise your problem file to avoid the repeat.
        Remember your goal is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet, i.e. your goal should be go to other not visited location but shouldn't be at one fixed location.
