> move east 
 You are in the backyard. In one part of the room you see a barbeque. There is also a workbench, that has nothing on it. You also see a patio chair, that has nothing on it. In another part of the room you see a patio table, that has nothing on it. In one part of the room you see a clothes line, that has nothing on it. There is also a garden, that has nothing on it. 
Through an open patio door, to the West you see the corridor.

        Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
        The format should strictly be:

            "df": "...",
            "pf": "..."
            }
    
        You are in an environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
        Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
        Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
        Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
        In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
        If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
        Here are your current observations: Action: move east
You are in the corridor. To the North you see the kitchen. To the East you see a closed patio door. Through an open wood door, to the West you see the bedroom. 

Action: open door to east
You open the patio door, revealing the backyard. 

Action: move east
You are in the backyard. Through an open patio door, to the West you see the corridor. 

        Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to south', 'close door to west', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']
        You should generate df and pf strictly follow this valid actions. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:

        2. :action move
            :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
        You should have a goal in the problem file like this: 
        (:goal 
            (at ?location)
        ) where location should be somewhere not visited

        This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations: Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the South you see the corridor. To the East you see a closed plain door. 
Action: move south
You are in the corridor. To the North you see the kitchen. To the East you see a closed patio door. To the West you see a closed wood door. 
Action: open door to west
You open the wood door, revealing the bedroom. 
Action: move west
You are in the bedroom. Through an open wood door, to the East you see the corridor. 
Action: move east
You are in the corridor. To the North you see the kitchen. To the East you see a closed patio door. Through an open wood door, to the West you see the bedroom. 
Action: open door to east
You open the patio door, revealing the backyard. 
Action: move east

        Now modify those two files according to the new observations and notes. Fix any errors you made in the previous setting according to the new observation.

        You have already generate files according to the observations. The df and pf can generate actions but after simulating,
        it got those errors: This is the action you take: open door to south.                                             When you try to open door, there is no door here or there is nothing in this direction.                                            If there is no door, you can directly move to that direction.
. Please review both files and fix them.
        Now modify those two files according to the error message.
