        Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
        The format should strictly be:

            "pf": "..."
            }
    
        You are in an environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
        Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
        Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
        Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
        In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
        If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
        Here are your current observations: Action: open door to north
You open the wood door, revealing the bathroom. 

Action: move north
You are in the bathroom. Through an open wood door, to the South you see the living room. To the East you see a closed wood door. To the West you see the bedroom. 

        Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to south', 'close door to west', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']
        You should generate df and pf strictly follow this valid actions. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:

        2. :action move
            :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
        You should have a goal in the problem file like this: 
        (:goal 
            (at ?location)
        ) where location should be somewhere not visited

> move west 
 You are in the bedroom. In one part of the room you see a dressing table, that has nothing on it. There is also a desk chair, that has nothing on it. You also see a desk, that has nothing on it. In another part of the room you see a chest of drawers that is closed. In one part of the room you see a wardrobe that is closed. There is also a night stand, that has nothing on it. You also see a bed, that has nothing on it. 
To the East you see the bathroom.

        Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
        The format should strictly be:
            {
            "df": "...",
            "pf": "..."
            }
    
        You are in an environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
        Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
        Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
        Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
        In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
        If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
        Here are your current observations: Action: move west
You are in the bedroom. To the East you see the bathroom. 

        Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to south', 'close door to west', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']
        You should generate df and pf strictly follow this valid actions. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:
        1. :action open-door
            :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
        2. :action move
            :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
        You should have a goal in the problem file like this: 
        (:goal 
            (at ?location)
        ) where location should be somewhere not visited
        Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status

        This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations: Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the South you see a closed plain door. To the West you see the corridor. 
Action: move west
You are in the corridor. To the North you see a closed wood door. To the South you see a closed sliding patio door. To the East you see the kitchen. To the West you see the living room. 
Action: move west
You are in the living room. To the North you see a closed wood door. To the East you see the corridor. 
Action: open door to north
You open the wood door, revealing the bathroom. 
Action: move north
You are in the bathroom. Through an open wood door, to the South you see the living room. To the East you see a closed wood door. To the West you see the bedroom. 
Action: move west

        Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
        The format should strictly be:

        You are in an environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
        Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
        Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
        Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
        In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
        If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
        Here are your current observations: Action: open door to south
You open the wood door, revealing the corridor. 

Action: move south
You are in the corridor. Through an open wood door, to the North you see the laundry room. To the South you see a closed sliding patio door. To the East you see the kitchen. To the West you see the living room. 

        Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to south', 'close door to west', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']
        You should generate df and pf strictly follow this valid actions. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:
        1. :action open-door

        2. :action move
            :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
        You should have a goal in the problem file like this: 
        (:goal 
            (at ?location)
        ) where location should be somewhere not visited

        You are in an environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
        Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
        Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
        Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
        In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
        If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.

Prompt: 
        Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
        The format should strictly be:
            {
            "df": "...",
            "pf": "..."
            }
    
        You are in an environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
        Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
        Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
        Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
        In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
        If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
        Here are your current observations: Action: open door to west
Unknown action: I'm not sure what you mean.

        Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to south', 'close door to west', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']
        You should generate df and pf strictly follow this valid actions. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:
        1. :action open-door
            :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
        2. :action move
            :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
        You should have a goal in the problem file like this: 
        (:goal 
            (at ?location)
        ) where location should be somewhere not visited
        Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status

        Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
        The format should strictly be:
            {

            "pf": "..."
            }
    
        You are in an environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
        Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
        Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
        Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
        In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
        If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
        Here are your current observations: Action: open door to west
Unknown action: I'm not sure what you mean.

        Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to south', 'close door to west', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']
        You should generate df and pf strictly follow this valid actions. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:
        1. :action open-door
            :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
        2. :action move
            :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
        You should have a goal in the problem file like this: 
        (:goal 
            (at ?location)
        ) where location should be somewhere not visited
        Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status

        Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
        Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
        Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
        In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
        If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
        Here are your current observations: Action: open door to west
Unknown action: I'm not sure what you mean.

        Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to south', 'close door to west', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']
        You should generate df and pf strictly follow this valid actions. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:
        1. :action open-door
            :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
        2. :action move
            :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
        You should have a goal in the problem file like this: 
        (:goal 
            (at ?location)
        ) where location should be somewhere not visited
        Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status

        You have already generate files according to the observations. The df and pf can generate actions but after simulating,
        it got those errors: This is the action you take: open door to west.                                             When you try to open door, there is no door here or there is nothing in this direction.                                            If there is no door, you can directly move to that direction.
. Please review both files and fix them.
