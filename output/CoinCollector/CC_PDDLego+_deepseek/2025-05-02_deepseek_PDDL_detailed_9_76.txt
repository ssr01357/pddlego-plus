        You are in an environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
        Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
        Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
        Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
        In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.

> move north 
 You are in the living room. In one part of the room you see a wastepaper basket that is closed. There is also a book case, that has nothing on it. You also see a TV stand, that has nothing on it. In another part of the room you see a arm chair, that has nothing on it. In one part of the room you see a side table, that has nothing on it. There is also a coffee table, that has nothing on it. You also see a end table, that has nothing on it. In another part of the room you see a sofa, that has nothing on it. 
To the North you see a closed wood door. To the South you see the corridor. To the East you see a closed sliding patio door.

Prompt: 
        Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
        The format should strictly be:
            {
            "df": "...",
            "pf": "..."
            }
    
        You are in an environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
        Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
        Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
        Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
        In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
        If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
        Here are your current observations: Action: move north
You are in the living room. To the North you see a closed wood door. To the South you see the corridor. To the East you see a closed sliding patio door. 

        Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to south', 'close door to west', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']
        You should generate df and pf strictly follow this valid actions. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:
        1. :action open-door
            :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
        2. :action move
            :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
        You should have a goal in the problem file like this: 
        (:goal 
            (at ?location)
        ) where location should be somewhere not visited
        Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status

        This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations: Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see a closed patio door. To the South you see a closed frosted-glass door. To the West you see the corridor. 
Action: move west
You are in the corridor. To the North you see the living room. To the South you see a closed wood door. To the East you see the kitchen. To the West you see a closed wood door. 
Action: move north
You are in the living room. To the North you see a closed wood door. To the South you see the corridor. To the East you see a closed sliding patio door. 

    
        Now modify those two files according to the new observations and notes. Fix any errors you made in the previous setting according to the new observation.
        Generate updated files based on your new observation.

You are in the kitchen. To the North you see a closed patio door. To the South you see a closed frosted-glass door. To the West you see the corridor. 
Action: move west
You are in the corridor. To the North you see the living room. To the South you see a closed wood door. To the East you see the kitchen. To the West you see a closed wood door. 
Action: move north
You are in the living room. To the North you see a closed wood door. To the South you see the corridor. To the East you see a closed sliding patio door. 
Action: open door to north
You open the wood door, revealing the bedroom. 
Action: move north
You are in the bedroom. Through an open wood door, to the South you see the living room.

        Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
        Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
        In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.

Prompt: 
        Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
        The format should strictly be:
            {
            "df": "...",
            "pf": "..."
            }
    
        You are in an environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
        Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
        Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
        Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
        In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
        If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
        Here are your current observations: Action: move south
You are in the living room. Through an open wood door, to the North you see the bedroom. To the South you see the corridor. To the East you see a closed sliding patio door. 

Action: open door to west
Unknown action: I'm not sure what you mean.

        Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to south', 'close door to west', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']
        You should generate df and pf strictly follow this valid actions. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:
        1. :action open-door
            :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
        2. :action move
            :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
        You should have a goal in the problem file like this: 
        (:goal 
            (at ?location)
        ) where location should be somewhere not visited
        Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status
