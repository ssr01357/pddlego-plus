        Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
        Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
        In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
        If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
        Here are your current observations: Action: open door to south_door

        Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to south', 'close door to west', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']

        You are in an environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
        Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
        Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
        Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
        In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
        If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
        Here are your current observations: Action: open door to south_door
Unknown action: I'm not sure what you mean.

        Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to south', 'close door to west', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']
        You should generate df and pf strictly follow this valid actions. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:
        1. :action open-door
            :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
        2. :action move
            :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
        You should have a goal in the problem file like this: 
        (:goal 
            (at ?location)
        ) where location should be somewhere not visited
        Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status
    
        This is previous domain file: (define (domain explore)
    (:requirements :strips :typing)
    (:types
        location
        direction
        door
    )
    (:predicates
        (at ?loc - location)
        (connects ?d - door ?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
        (open ?d - door)
        (closed ?d - door)
        (visited ?loc - location)
    )
    (:action open-door
        :parameters (?d - door ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
        :precondition (and (at ?loc1) (connects ?d ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir) (closed ?d))
        :effect (and (open ?d) (not (closed ?d)))
    (:action move
        :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
        :precondition (and (at ?from) (exists (?d - door) (and (connects ?d ?from ?to ?dir) (open ?d)))
        :effect (and (at ?to) (not (at ?from)) (visited ?to))
)
        This is previous problem file: (define (problem kitchen-explore)
    (:domain explore)
    (:objects
        kitchen - location
        room_west - location
        room_south - location
        west_door - door
        south_door - door
        west - direction
        south - direction
    )
    (:init
        (at kitchen)
        (visited kitchen)
        (closed west_door)
        (closed south_door)
        (connects west_door kitchen room_west west)
        (connects south_door kitchen room_south south)
    )
    (:goal
        (exists (?loc - location) (and (not (visited ?loc)) (at ?loc))
)
        This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations: Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see a closed wood door. To the East you see a closed screen door. To the West you see a closed plain door. 

    
        You made some mistakes when generating those files. Here is the error message: None; 
domain: syntax error in line 19, '(':
domain definition expected

        Now modify those two files according to the error message.
    
        You have already generate files according to the observations. The df and pf can generate actions but after simulating,
        it got those errors: This is the action you take: open door to south_door.                                             When you try to open door, there is no door here or there is nothing in this direction.                                            If there is no door, you can directly move to that direction.
. Please review both files and fix them.
        Now modify those two files according to the error message.
