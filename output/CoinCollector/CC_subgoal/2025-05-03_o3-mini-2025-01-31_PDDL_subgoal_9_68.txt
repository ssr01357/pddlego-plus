        Here are your current observations: Action: move east
You are in the living room. Through an open wood door, to the South you see the bathroom. Through an open wood door, to the West you see the bedroom. 

Action: move south
You are in the bathroom. Through an open wood door, to the North you see the living room. Through an open wood door, to the South you see the corridor. 

Action: move south
You are in the corridor. Through an open wood door, to the North you see the bathroom. Through an open wood door, to the South you see the laundry room. To the East you see the kitchen. To the West you see the driveway. 

Action: open door to north
That is already open.

        Generate updated files based on your new observation.
    
        You have already generate files according to the observations. The df and pf can generate actions but after simulating,
        it got those errors: This is the action you take: open door to east.                                             When you try to open door, there is no door here or there is nothing in this direction.                                            If there is no door, you can directly move to that direction.
. Please review both files and fix them.
        Now modify those two files according to the error message.
