        This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations: Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see a closed frosted-glass door. To the South you see a closed screen door. To the West you see the corridor. 
Action: move west
You are in the corridor. To the East you see the kitchen. To the West you see a closed wood door.
