        Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.

        Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to south', 'close door to west', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']

        In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
        If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
        Here are your current observations: Action: move west
You are in the bathroom. Through an open wood door, to the North you see the living room. To the South you see a closed wood door. Through an open wood door, to the East you see the laundry room. 

Action: open door to south
You open the wood door, revealing the corridor. 

Action: move south
You are in the corridor. Through an open wood door, to the North you see the bathroom. 

        Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to south', 'close door to west', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']
        You should generate df and pf strictly follow this valid actions. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:

Prompt: 
        Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
        The format should strictly be:
            {
            "df": "...",
            "pf": "..."
            }
    
        You are in an environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
        Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
        Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
        Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
        In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
        If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
        Here are your current observations: Action: move north
You are in the bathroom. Through an open wood door, to the North you see the living room. Through an open wood door, to the South you see the corridor. Through an open wood door, to the East you see the laundry room. 

Action: move north
You are in the living room. To the North you see the kitchen. Through an open wood door, to the South you see the bathroom. Through an open wood door, to the West you see the bedroom. 

Action: move north
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see a closed plain door. To the South you see the living room. To the East you see a closed patio door. 

Action: open door to north
You open the plain door, revealing the pantry. 

Action: move north
You are in the pantry. Through an open plain door, to the South you see the kitchen. 

        Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to south', 'close door to west', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']
        You should generate df and pf strictly follow this valid actions. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:

        2. :action move

        Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
        The format should strictly be:
            {
            "df": "...",
            "pf": "..."
            }
    
        You are in an environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
        Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
        Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
        Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
        In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
        If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
        Here are your current observations: Action: move north
You are in the bathroom. Through an open wood door, to the North you see the living room. Through an open wood door, to the South you see the corridor. Through an open wood door, to the East you see the laundry room. 

Action: move north
You are in the living room. To the North you see the kitchen. Through an open wood door, to the South you see the bathroom. Through an open wood door, to the West you see the bedroom. 

Action: move north
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see a closed plain door. To the South you see the living room. To the East you see a closed patio door. 

Action: open door to north
You open the plain door, revealing the pantry. 

Action: move north
You are in the pantry. Through an open plain door, to the South you see the kitchen. 

        Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to south', 'close door to west', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']
        You should generate df and pf strictly follow this valid actions. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:
        1. :action open-door
            :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
        2. :action move
