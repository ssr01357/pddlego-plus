You are in the corridor. To the North you see the kitchen. To the West you see a closed wood door.

Prompt: 
        Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
        The format should strictly be:
            {
            "df": "...",
            "pf": "..."
            }
    
        You are in an environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
        Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
        Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
        Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
        In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
        If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
        Here are your current observations: Action: move west
You can't move there, the door is closed. 

        Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to south', 'close door to west', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']
        You should generate df and pf strictly follow this valid actions. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:
        1. :action open-door
            :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
        2. :action move
            :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
        Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status
    
        This is previous domain file: (define (domain explore-env)
  (:requirements :strips :typing)

    (door-open ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
    (door-closed ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
    (connected ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
  )

  (:action open-door
    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
    :precondition (and (at ?loc1) (door-closed ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir))
    :effect (and (door-open ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir))
  )

    :precondition (and (at ?from) (connected ?from ?to ?dir))
    :effect (and (at ?to) (visited ?to))

        This is previous problem file: (define (problem explore-env-prob)

        This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations: Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see a closed plain door. To the South you see the corridor. To the East you see a closed sliding patio door. 
Action: move south
You are in the corridor. To the North you see the kitchen. To the West you see a closed wood door. 

    
        Now modify those two files according to the new observations and notes. Fix any errors you made in the previous setting according to the new observation.
        Generate updated files based on your new observation.
    
        You have already generate files according to the observations. The df and pf can generate actions but after simulating,
        it got those errors: This is the action you take: move west.                                         The door that you are moving to is closed.                                         You should first open door to that direction then move there!. Please review both files and fix them.
        Now modify those two files according to the error message.
