Observations: You are in the kitchen. In one part of the room you see a stove. There is also an oven. You also see a fridge that is closed. In another part of the room you see a counter, that has nothing on it. In one part of the room you see a kitchen cupboard that is closed. There is also a cutlery drawer that is closed. You also see a trash can that is closed. In another part of the room you see a dishwasher that is closed. In one part of the room you see a dining chair, that has nothing on it. 
To the North you see the corridor. To the South you see a closed frosted-glass door.

Prompt: 
        Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
        The format should strictly be:
            {
            "df": "...",
            "pf": "..."
            }
    
        You are in an environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
        Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
        Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
        Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
        In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
        If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
        Here are your current observations: Action: open door to north
Unknown action: I'm not sure what you mean.

        Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to south', 'close door to west', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']
        You should generate df and pf strictly follow this valid actions. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:
        1. :action open-door
            :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
        2. :action move
            :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
        Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status
    
        This is previous domain file: (define (domain simple-exploration)
(:predicates 
    (at ?loc - location)
    (door ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
    (open ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
)

    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
    :precondition (door ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir)

    :precondition (and (at ?from) (open ?from ?to ?dir))
    :effect (and (not (at ?from)) (at ?to))
)

        This is previous problem file: (define (problem explore-environment)

    (door kitchen corridor north)
    (door kitchen unknown-room south)
)
(:goal 
    (and (not (at kitchen)) (exists (?loc - location) (not (at ?loc))))
)
)

        This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations: Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see the corridor. To the South you see a closed frosted-glass door. 

    
        You made some mistakes when generating those files. Here is the error message: None; free(): double free detected in tcache 2
Aborted (core dumped)

        Now modify those two files according to the error message.
    
        You have already generate files according to the observations. The df and pf can generate actions but after simulating,
        it got those errors: This is the action you take: open door to north.                                             When you try to open door, there is no door here or there is nothing in this direction.                                            If there is no door, you can directly move to that direction.
. Please review both files and fix them.
        Now modify those two files according to the error message.
    
        You are repeating the same sequence of actions for at least three times. You may stuck in one location or have the wrong goal.
        You should revise your problem file to avoid the repeat.
        Remember your goal is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet, i.e. your goal should be go to other not visited location but shouldn't be at one fixed location.
