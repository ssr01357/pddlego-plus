        This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations: Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see the corridor. To the South you see a closed patio door. To the East you see a closed wood door. To the West you see a closed frosted-glass door. 

    
        You made some mistakes when generating those files. Here is the error message: None; 
domain: syntax error in line 16, '(':

        Now modify those two files according to the error message.
    
        You have already generate files according to the observations. The df and pf can generate actions but after simulating,
        it got those errors: This is the action you take: open door to south.                                             When you try to open door, there is no door here or there is nothing in this direction.                                            If there is no door, you can directly move to that direction.
. Please review both files and fix them.

        Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'.

        You are in an environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
        Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
        Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
        Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
        In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
        If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
        Here are your current observations: Action: move south
You can't move there, the door is closed. 

        Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to south', 'close door to west', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']
        You should generate df and pf strictly follow this valid actions. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:
