        You are in an environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
        Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
        Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
        Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
        In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
        If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
        Here are your current observations: Action: move north
You are in the kitchen. Through an open frosted-glass door, to the South you see the pantry. To the West you see the corridor. 

Action: move west
You are in the corridor. To the North you see a closed patio door. To the South you see a closed wood door. To the East you see the kitchen. To the West you see a closed wood door. 

        Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to south', 'close door to west', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']
        You should generate df and pf strictly follow this valid actions. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:

        Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
        Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
        In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.

You open the wood door, revealing the bathroom. 

Action: move west
You are in the bathroom. To the North you see a closed wood door. Through an open wood door, to the East you see the corridor. 

Action: open door to south

        Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to south', 'close door to west', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']

Prompt: 
        Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
        The format should strictly be:
            {
            "df": "...",
            "pf": "..."
            }
    
        You are in an environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
        Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
        Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
        Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
        In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
        If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
        Here are your current observations: Action: move south
You can't move there, the door is closed. 

        Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to south', 'close door to west', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']
        You should generate df and pf strictly follow this valid actions. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:
        1. :action open-door
            :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
        2. :action move
            :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
        Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status

        This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations: Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the South you see a closed frosted-glass door. To the West you see the corridor. 
Action: open door to south
You open the frosted-glass door, revealing the pantry. 
Action: move south
You are in the pantry. Through an open frosted-glass door, to the North you see the kitchen. 
Action: move north
You are in the kitchen. Through an open frosted-glass door, to the South you see the pantry. To the West you see the corridor. 
Action: move west
You are in the corridor. To the North you see a closed patio door. To the South you see a closed wood door. To the East you see the kitchen. To the West you see a closed wood door. 

    
        Now modify those two files according to the new observations and notes. Fix any errors you made in the previous setting according to the new observation.
        Generate updated files based on your new observation.
    
        You have already generate files according to the observations. The df and pf can generate actions but after simulating,
        it got those errors: This is the action you take: move south.                                         The door that you are moving to is closed.                                         You should first open door to that direction then move there!. Please review both files and fix them.
        Now modify those two files according to the error message.
