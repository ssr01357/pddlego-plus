        Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
        The format should strictly be:
            {
            "df": "...",
            "pf": "..."
            }
    
        You are in an environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
        Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
        Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
        Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
        In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
        If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
        Here are your current observations: Action: move north
You are in the corridor. To the North you see a closed wood door. To the South you see the driveway. To the East you see the kitchen. To the West you see a closed wood door. 

Action: move east
You are in the kitchen. To the South you see a closed plain door. To the East you see a closed wood door. To the West you see the corridor. 

Action: open door to south
You open the plain door, revealing the pantry. 

Action: move south
You are in the pantry. Through an open plain door, to the North you see the kitchen. 

        Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to south', 'close door to west', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']
        You should generate df and pf strictly follow this valid actions. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:

        In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.

You are in the kitchen. Through an open plain door, to the South you see the pantry. To the East you see a closed wood door. To the West you see the corridor. 

Action: open door to east
You open the wood door, revealing the bathroom.
