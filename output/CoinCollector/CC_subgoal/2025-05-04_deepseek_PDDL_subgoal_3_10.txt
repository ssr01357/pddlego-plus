        You are repeating the same sequence of actions for at least three times. You may stuck in one location or have the wrong goal.
        You should revise your problem file to avoid the repeat.
        Remember your goal is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet, i.e. your goal should be go to other not visited location but shouldn't be at one fixed location.

Error: None 
Prompt: 
        Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
        The format should strictly be:
            {
            "df": "...",
            "pf": "..."
            }
    
        You are in an environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
        Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
        Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
        Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
        In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
        If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
        Here are your current observations: Action: open door to south
Unknown action: I'm not sure what you mean.

        Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to south', 'close door to west', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']
        You should generate df and pf strictly follow this valid actions. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:
        1. :action open-door
            :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
        2. :action move
            :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
        Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status
    
        This is previous domain file: (define (domain exploration)
  (:requirements :strips :typing :negative-preconditions)
  (:types
    location ; Represents the rooms or areas
    direction ; Represents the directions (north, south, etc.)
  )
  (:predicates

    (door-open ?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
    (door-closed ?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
    (visited ?loc - location)
  )
  (:action open-door
    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
    :precondition (and (connected ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir) (door-closed ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir))
    :effect (and (not (door-closed ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir)) (door-open ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir))
  )
  (:action move
    :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
    :precondition (and (connected ?from ?to ?dir) (or (door-open ?from ?to ?dir) (not (door-closed ?from ?to ?dir))))
    :effect (and (visited ?to) (not (visited ?from)))
  )
)
        This is previous problem file: (define (problem kitchen-exploration)
  (:domain exploration)
  (:objects
    kitchen corridor north_room south_room west_room - location
    north south west - direction
  )
  (:init
    (connected kitchen corridor south)
    (connected corridor kitchen north)
    (connected corridor south_room south)
    (door-closed corridor south_room south)
    (connected corridor west_room west)
    (door-closed corridor west_room west)
    (connected kitchen north_room north)
    (door-closed kitchen north_room north)
    (visited kitchen)
    (visited corridor)
  )
  (:goal (forall (?l - location) (visited ?l))
)
        This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations: Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see a closed plain door. To the South you see the corridor. 

    
        You made some mistakes when generating those files. Here is the error message: None; 
problem: syntax error in line 20, '':
'define' expected

        Now modify those two files according to the error message.
    
        You have already generate files according to the observations. The df and pf can generate actions but after simulating,
        it got those errors: This is the action you take: open door to south.                                             When you try to open door, there is no door here or there is nothing in this direction.                                            If there is no door, you can directly move to that direction.
. Please review both files and fix them.
        Now modify those two files according to the error message.
    
        You are repeating the same sequence of actions for at least three times. You may stuck in one location or have the wrong goal.
        You should revise your problem file to avoid the repeat.
        Remember your goal is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet, i.e. your goal should be go to other not visited location but shouldn't be at one fixed location.
