        You are in an environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
        Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
        Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
        Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
        In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
        If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
        Here are your current observations: Action: move north
You are in the corridor. To the North you see the kitchen. Through an open wood door, to the South you see the bedroom. 

Action: move north
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see a closed frosted-glass door. To the South you see the corridor. To the East you see the living room. To the West you see a closed screen door. 

Action: move east
You are in the living room. To the North you see a closed wood door. To the West you see the kitchen. 

        Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to south', 'close door to west', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']
        You should generate df and pf strictly follow this valid actions. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:
        1. :action open-door
            :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
        2. :action move
            :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
        Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status

        This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations: Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see a closed frosted-glass door. To the South you see the corridor. To the East you see the living room. To the West you see a closed screen door. 
Action: move south
You are in the corridor. To the North you see the kitchen. To the South you see a closed wood door. 
Action: open door to south
You open the wood door, revealing the bedroom. 
Action: move south
You are in the bedroom. Through an open wood door, to the North you see the corridor. 
Action: move north
You are in the corridor. To the North you see the kitchen. Through an open wood door, to the South you see the bedroom. 
Action: move north
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see a closed frosted-glass door. To the South you see the corridor. To the East you see the living room. To the West you see a closed screen door. 
Action: move east
You are in the living room. To the North you see a closed wood door. To the West you see the kitchen. 

    
        You made some mistakes when generating those files. Here is the error message: None; 
        Now modify those two files according to the error message.
