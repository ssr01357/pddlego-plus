        You are in an environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
        Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
        Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
        Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
        In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
        If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
        Here are your current observations: Action: open door to east

You are in the kitchen. To the North you see a closed wood door. To the East you see the corridor. To the West you see a closed plain door. 
Action: open door to north
You open the wood door, revealing the bathroom. 
Action: move north
You are in the bathroom. Through an open wood door, to the South you see the kitchen. To the East you see the bedroom. 
Action: move south
You are in the kitchen. Through an open wood door, to the North you see the bathroom. To the East you see the corridor. To the West you see a closed plain door. 
Action: move north
You are in the bathroom. Through an open wood door, to the South you see the kitchen. To the East you see the bedroom. 

    
        Now modify those two files according to the new observations and notes. Fix any errors you made in the previous setting according to the new observation.
        Generate updated files based on your new observation.
    
        You have already generate files according to the observations. The df and pf can generate actions but after simulating,
