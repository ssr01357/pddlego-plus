        Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
        Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
        In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.

You are in the kitchen. To the North you see a closed wood door. To the East you see a closed screen door. To the West you see a closed plain door. 
Action: open door to east
You open the screen door, revealing the backyard. 
Action: move east
You are in the backyard. To the North you see a closed sliding patio door. To the South you see the street. To the East you see the driveway. Through an open screen door, to the West you see the kitchen. 
Action: open door to north

Action: move north
You are in the bathroom. Through an open wood door, to the South you see the living room. To the East you see the bedroom. 

    
        Now modify those two files according to the new observations and notes. Fix any errors you made in the previous setting according to the new observation.
        Generate updated files based on your new observation.
    
        You have already generate files according to the observations. The df and pf can generate actions but after simulating,
        it got those errors: This is the action you take: open door to east.                                             When you try to open door, there is no door here or there is nothing in this direction.                                            If there is no door, you can directly move to that direction.
. Please review both files and fix them.
        Now modify those two files according to the error message.

        Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
        Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
        In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.

 You are in the corridor. In one part of the room you see a key holder, that has nothing on it. There is also a shoe cabinet that is closed. You also see a umbrella stand, that has nothing on it. In another part of the room you see a hat rack, that has nothing on it. In one part of the room you see a coat hanger, that has nothing on it. 
Through an open wood door, to the North you see the bedroom. To the South you see the driveway. To the West you see the living room.

Action: move south
You are in the corridor. Through an open wood door, to the North you see the bedroom. To the South you see the driveway. To the West you see the living room. 

        Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to south', 'close door to west', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']
