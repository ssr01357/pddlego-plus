Prompt: 
        Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
        The format should strictly be:
            {
            "df": "...",
            "pf": "..."
            }
    
        You are in an environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
        Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
        Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
        Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
        In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
        If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
        Here are your current observations: Action: move north
You are in the bedroom. To the South you see the bathroom. Through an open wood door, to the East you see the living room. To the West you see a closed wood door. 

Action: move east
You are in the living room. To the North you see the kitchen. Through an open wood door, to the West you see the bedroom. 

Action: move north
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see a closed screen door. To the South you see the living room. Through an open plain door, to the East you see the pantry. 

Action: open door to north
You open the screen door, revealing the backyard. 

Action: move north
You are in the backyard. Through an open screen door, to the South you see the kitchen. 

        Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to south', 'close door to west', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']
        You should generate df and pf strictly follow this valid actions. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:
        1. :action open-door
            :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
        2. :action move
