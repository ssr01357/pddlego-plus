Observations: You are in the kitchen. In one part of the room you see a stove. There is also an oven. You also see a fridge that is closed. In another part of the room you see a counter, that has nothing on it. In one part of the room you see a kitchen cupboard that is closed. There is also a cutlery drawer that is closed. You also see a trash can that is closed. In another part of the room you see a dishwasher that is closed. In one part of the room you see a dining chair, that has nothing on it. There is also a coin. 
To the North you see a closed plain door. To the East you see a closed sliding patio door.  
Gold path: ['look around', 'take coin'] 
Valid Actions: ['move east', 'close door to east', 'move north', 'inventory', 'look around', 'close door to north', 'open door to north', 'take coin', 'open door to east'] 
taskDescription: Your task is to search the environment and find the coin.  Once you find the coin, take it. 
brief_obs: Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see a closed plain door. To the East you see a closed sliding patio door.

You are in the kitchen. To the North you see a closed plain door. To the East you see a closed sliding patio door. 

        Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to south', 'close door to west', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']
        You should generate df and pf strictly follow this valid actions. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:
        1. :action open-door
            :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
        2. :action move
            :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
        Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status
    
        This is previous domain file: (define (domain house-navigation) (:predicates (room ?loc - location) (door ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction ?type - doortype) (open ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction ?type - doortype) (at ?loc - location)) (:action open-door :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction) :precondition (and (door ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir plain)) :effect (open ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir plain)) (:action open-door :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction) :precondition (and (door ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir sliding)) :effect (open ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir sliding)) (:action move :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction) :precondition (and (at ?from) (open ?from ?to ?dir ?type)) :effect (and (at ?to) (not (at ?from)))))
        This is previous problem file: (define (problem navigate-house) (:domain house-navigation) (:objects kitchen - location room_north - location patio_east - location plain - doortype sliding - doortype north east - direction) (:init (room kitchen) (room room_north) (room patio_east) (door kitchen room_north north plain) (door kitchen patio_east east sliding) (at kitchen)) (:goal (and (at room_north)) ) )
        This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations: None
    
        You made some mistakes when generating those files. Here is the error message: None; 
        Now modify those two files according to the error message.
     
Generated df and pf:
