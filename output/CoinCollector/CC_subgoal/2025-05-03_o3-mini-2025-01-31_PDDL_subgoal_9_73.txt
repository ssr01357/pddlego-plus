 You are in the bedroom. In one part of the room you see a dressing table, that has nothing on it. There is also a desk chair, that has nothing on it. You also see a desk, that has nothing on it. In another part of the room you see a chest of drawers that is closed. In one part of the room you see a wardrobe that is closed. There is also a night stand, that has nothing on it. You also see a bed, that has nothing on it. 
Through an open wood door, to the South you see the living room.

You are in the kitchen. To the North you see a closed patio door. To the South you see a closed frosted-glass door. To the West you see the corridor. 
Action: move west
You are in the corridor. To the North you see the living room. To the South you see a closed wood door. To the East you see the kitchen. To the West you see a closed wood door. 
Action: move north
You are in the living room. To the North you see a closed wood door. To the South you see the corridor. To the East you see a closed sliding patio door. 
Action: open door to north
You open the wood door, revealing the bedroom. 
Action: move north
You are in the bedroom. Through an open wood door, to the South you see the living room.
