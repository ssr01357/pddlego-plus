        Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
        The format should strictly be:
            {
            "df": "...",
            "pf": "..."
            }
    
        You are in an environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
        Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
        Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
        Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
        In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
        If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
        Here are your current observations: Action: move south
You are in the corridor. To the North you see the kitchen. 

        Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to south', 'close door to west', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']
        You should generate df and pf strictly follow this valid actions. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:
        1. :action open-door
            :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
        2. :action move
            :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
        Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status
    
        This is previous domain file: (define (domain explore) (:predicates (at ?loc - location) (connected ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?direction - direction) (door-open ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location) (visited ?loc - location)) (:action open-door :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction) :precondition (connected ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir) :effect (door-open ?loc1 ?loc2)) (:action move :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction) :precondition (and (at ?from) (connected ?from ?to ?dir) (door-open ?from ?to)) :effect (and (at ?to) (visited ?to) (not (at ?from)))))
        This is previous problem file: (define (problem explore-problem) (:domain explore) (:objects kitchen corridor - location north south - direction) (:init (at corridor) (visited kitchen) (visited corridor) (connected kitchen corridor south) (connected corridor kitchen north) (door-open kitchen corridor) (door-open corridor kitchen)) (:goal (and (visited corridor) (visited kitchen) (at corridor))))
        This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations: Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see a closed plain door. To the South you see the corridor. 
Action: move south
You are in the corridor. To the North you see the kitchen. 

    
        You made some mistakes when generating those files. Here is the error message: None; 
        Now modify those two files according to the error message.
