Error: None 
Prompt: 
        Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
        The format should strictly be:
            {
            "df": "...",
            "pf": "..."
            }
    
        You are in an environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
        Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
        Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
        Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
        In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
        If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
        Here are your current observations: Action: open door to north
You open the wood door, revealing the bathroom. 

Action: move north
You are in the bathroom. To the North you see a closed wood door. Through an open wood door, to the South you see the corridor. To the East you see a closed wood door. 

        Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to south', 'close door to west', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']
        You should generate df and pf strictly follow this valid actions. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:
        1. :action open-door
            :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
        2. :action move
            :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
        Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status
    
        This is previous domain file: (define (domain exploration)
  (:requirements :typing)
  (:types location direction)
  (:predicates
    (at ?loc - location)
    (connected ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
    (door-closed ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
    (door-open ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
  )

  (:action open-door
    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
    :precondition (door-closed ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir)
    :effect (and (not (door-closed ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir)) (door-open ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir))
  )

  (:action move
    :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
    :precondition (and (at ?from) (connected ?from ?to ?dir) (door-open ?from ?to ?dir))
    :effect (and (not (at ?from)) (at ?to))
  )
)

        This is previous problem file: (define (problem exploration-prob)
  (:domain exploration)
  (:objects
    kitchen corridor room_north room_east room_west room_kitchen_west - location
    north south east west - direction
  )
  (:init
    (at corridor)

    ; Connection between kitchen and corridor observed from the kitchen (look around action)
    (connected kitchen corridor north)
    (connected corridor kitchen south)

    ; In corridor: a closed wood door to the north leads to an unseen room
    (connected corridor room_north north)
    (door-closed corridor room_north north)

    ; In corridor: a closed screen door to the east leads to an unseen room
    (connected corridor room_east east)
    (door-closed corridor room_east east)

    ; In corridor: a closed wood door to the west leads to an unseen room
    (connected corridor room_west west)
    (door-closed corridor room_west west)

    ; In kitchen: a closed frosted-glass door to the west leads to an unseen room
    (connected kitchen room_kitchen_west west)
    (door-closed kitchen room_kitchen_west west)
  )
  (:goal (at room_north))
)

        This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations: Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see the corridor. To the West you see a closed frosted-glass door. 
Action: move north
You are in the corridor. To the North you see a closed wood door. To the South you see the kitchen. To the East you see a closed screen door. To the West you see a closed wood door. 
Action: open door to north
You open the wood door, revealing the bathroom. 
Action: move north
You are in the bathroom. To the North you see a closed wood door. Through an open wood door, to the South you see the corridor. To the East you see a closed wood door. 

    
        Now modify those two files according to the new observations and notes. Fix any errors you made in the previous setting according to the new observation.
        Generate updated files based on your new observation.
