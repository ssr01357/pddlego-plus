Observations: You are in the kitchen. In one part of the room you see a stove. There is also an oven. You also see a fridge that is closed. In another part of the room you see a counter, that has nothing on it. In one part of the room you see a kitchen cupboard that is closed. There is also a cutlery drawer that is closed. You also see a trash can that is closed. In another part of the room you see a dishwasher that is closed. In one part of the room you see a dining chair, that has nothing on it. There is also a coin. 
To the North you see a closed plain door. To the West you see the corridor.  
Gold path: ['look around', 'take coin'] 
Valid Actions: ['inventory', 'look around', 'move west', 'move north', 'take coin', 'open door to north', 'close door to north'] 
taskDescription: Your task is to search the environment and find the coin.  Once you find the coin, take it.

 You are in the corridor. In one part of the room you see a key holder, that has nothing on it. There is also a shoe cabinet that is closed. You also see a umbrella stand, that has nothing on it. In another part of the room you see a hat rack, that has nothing on it. In one part of the room you see a coat hanger, that has nothing on it. 
To the East you see the kitchen.
