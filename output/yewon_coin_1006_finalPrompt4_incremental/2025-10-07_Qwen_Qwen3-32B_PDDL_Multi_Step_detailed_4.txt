You are in a partially observable environment that you explore step by step. Your task is to generate a PDDL domain file ('df') based on the observations and valid actions.
Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.

Here are some valid actions you can take: ['move east', 'move north', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to east', 'open door to north', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']

You should generate a df that strictly follows these valid actions. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:

You are in a partially observable environment that you explore step by step. Your output must be one single, complete PDDL problem file. To create it, add a `(:goal ...)` section to the provided objects and initial state, then wrap everything in the standard `(define (problem ...))` structure.

Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
In other words, your goal should be to go to another not visited location.

You made some mistakes when generating those files. Here is the error message:

Prompt: 
    Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
    The format should strictly be:
        {
        "df": "...",
        "pf": "..."
        }


You are in a partially observable environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
Here are your current observations: Action: move north
You are in the corridor. To the North you see a closed wood door. To the South you see the driveway. To the East you see the kitchen. To the West you see a closed wood door. 

Action: open door to north
You open the wood door, revealing the bathroom. 

Action: move north
You are in the bathroom. Through an open wood door, to the South you see the corridor. To the West you see a closed wood door. 

Here are some valid actions you can take: ['move east', 'move north', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to east', 'open door to north', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']
You should generate df and pf that strictly follow these action schemas. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:
1. :action open-door
    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
2. :action move
    :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
You should have a goal in the problem file like this: 
(:goal 
    (at ?location)
) 


Note: 
- In problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status.
- In problem file's goal, ?location must be grounded, no variables or quantifiers.


This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations: 
Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see a closed sliding patio door. To the South you see a closed wood door. To the East you see a closed frosted-glass door. To the West you see the corridor. 
Action: move west
You are in the corridor. To the North you see a closed wood door. To the South you see the driveway. To the East you see the kitchen. To the West you see a closed wood door. 
Action: move south
You are in the driveway. To the North you see the corridor. 
Action: move north
You are in the corridor. To the North you see a closed wood door. To the South you see the driveway. To the East you see the kitchen. To the West you see a closed wood door. 
Action: open door to north
You open the wood door, revealing the bathroom. 
Action: move north
You are in the bathroom. Through an open wood door, to the South you see the corridor. To the West you see a closed wood door. 


You have already generated df and pf files according to the observations.
