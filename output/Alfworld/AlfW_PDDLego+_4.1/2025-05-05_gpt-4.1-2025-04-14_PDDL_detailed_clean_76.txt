        Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
        The format should strictly be:

            "pf": "..."
            }
    
        You are in an environment that you must explore step by step. Your task is to build and update PDDL files for the environment using only your direct observations. Do not create or assume any objects, relationships, or details that have not been observed, and ensure you include all observations.

        The environment is a room containing various objects. Some of these objects are on, in, or contained within other objects and receptacles. You will initially be located as init_receptacle. You can assume all receptacles are freely reachable.
        
        Now, Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.
        Here are your current observations: Action: look around
You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you see a bathtubbasin 1, a cabinet 4, a cabinet 3, a cabinet 2, a cabinet 1, a countertop 1, a drawer 4, a drawer 3, a drawer 2, a drawer 1, a dresser 1, a garbagecan 1, a handtowelholder 1, a sinkbasin 2, a sinkbasin 1, a toilet 1, a toiletpaperhanger 1, and a towelholder 1.


        Only the following actions are allowed: (There are only two types: object and receptacle)
        1. go to a receptacle
            :action GotoLocation
            :parameters (?from - receptacle ?to - receptacle)
        2. open a receptacle if it is closed
            :action OpenObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        3. close a receptacle
            :action CloseObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        4. take an object from another receptacle
            :action PickupObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        5. put object into/on/in another receptacle
            :action PutObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        6. using an object/receptacle by turning it on/off with a switch
            :action useObject
            :parameters (?o - object)
        7. heat an object using a receptacle
            :action HeatObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - microwaveReceptacle)
        8. clean an object using a receptacle
            :action CleanObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - sinkbasinReceptacle)
        9. cool an object using a receptacle
            :action CoolObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - fridgeReceptacle)
        10. slice an object using a sharp object
            :action SliceObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle ?co - object ?sharp_o - sharpObject)

        You must go to a receptacle first in order to use/open it or take/put objects from/on it.

        The process involves two main stages:

        1. Always searching for the aim Object first!!!
            In this stage, your goal is to go to and may need to open new, unvisited recepatacles until you find the object mentioned in the task. Some receptacles cannot be opened so you can directly see what objects after you go to that receptacle.

            You can only use the GotoLocation action to travel to a new location and the OpenObject action (if the receptacle is closed) to verify whether it contains the target object.

            Goal 1.1: Reach a location that has not been visited (the location should be a receptacle) using the GotoLocation action. 
                You goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (at ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be somewhere or some recepatacles not visited.

            Goal 1.2: If you already go to the recepatacle and found the recepatacle is closed, use the OpenObject action to open it and inspect the contents. 
                Your goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (opened ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be the recepatacle you want to open.

        2. After you seeing the aim object in any receptacle, using the Object to Complete the Task:
            After you have located the object (the object may have some numbers added), you should always first pick up the object from that receptacle and update your goal to focus on how the object is used to complete the task. Remember your goal is Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.. Based on different adjectives, you may need to perform different actions for the object in different ways.

            This may involve more than simply transferring it from one place to another.
            For example: You might examine the object or a nearby receptacle to gather information. You may need to use another tool or device (like a lamp or a switch). Some tasks require you to slice, heat, cool, or clean the object using an appropriate receptacle (e.g., microwave, sink, fridge).

            If necessary, use the PickupObject action to retrieve the item, and the GotoLocation action to move to the correct place.
            Then, apply the object in a purposeful way — not just move it — but interact with the environment to fulfill the task’s actual goal.

            Hint: 
            1. If you want to heat, clean, and cool an object, after you go to that aim receptacle, do not put the object in the receptacle but do the action directly. For example, go to fridge, then cool the object with receptacle.
            2. If you want to slice an object, you should first go to the receptacle where both the sharp object and the aim object are located and ONLY pick up the sharp object then do the slice action. Don't forget to put the sharp object back to the receptacle after you finish slicing.
            3. If you want to examine or look at an object with a lamp, you should first go to the receptacle where the object is located and then pick it up and take the USE action of the lamp. You don't need to take the lamp but directly use it.
            4. If there are multiple actions needed to complete the task, you can break them down into smaller subgoals. For example, if you need to slice and then heat an object, first focus on slicing it, and then move on to heating it.

        In summary, the first stage is all about finding the object—this might involve going to an unvisited receptacle and opening it if necessary.
        
        Note: 
        1. some receptacles have numbers in their names. Always keep them as they are. For example, "towelholder1" should not be changed to "towelholder".
        2. Your initial goal should always be to go to a new location instead of put something into somewhere.
        3. Do not enter stage 2 when not finishing stage 1.

        Note: Always include :negative-preconditions in your :requirements whenever you use (not …) or delete effects, and never leave an :precondition or :effect block empty—either omit it or include at least one literal.

            "pf": "..."
            }
    
        You are in an environment that you must explore step by step. Your task is to build and update PDDL files for the environment using only your direct observations. Do not create or assume any objects, relationships, or details that have not been observed, and ensure you include all observations.

        The environment is a room containing various objects. Some of these objects are on, in, or contained within other objects and receptacles. You will initially be located as init_receptacle. You can assume all receptacles are freely reachable.
        
        Now, Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.
        Here are your current observations: Action: look around
You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you see a bathtubbasin 1, a cabinet 4, a cabinet 3, a cabinet 2, a cabinet 1, a countertop 1, a drawer 4, a drawer 3, a drawer 2, a drawer 1, a dresser 1, a garbagecan 1, a handtowelholder 1, a sinkbasin 2, a sinkbasin 1, a toilet 1, a toiletpaperhanger 1, and a towelholder 1.


        Only the following actions are allowed: (There are only two types: object and receptacle)
        1. go to a receptacle
            :action GotoLocation
            :parameters (?from - receptacle ?to - receptacle)
        2. open a receptacle if it is closed
            :action OpenObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        3. close a receptacle
            :action CloseObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        4. take an object from another receptacle
            :action PickupObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        5. put object into/on/in another receptacle
            :action PutObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        6. using an object/receptacle by turning it on/off with a switch
            :action useObject
            :parameters (?o - object)
        7. heat an object using a receptacle
            :action HeatObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - microwaveReceptacle)
        8. clean an object using a receptacle
            :action CleanObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - sinkbasinReceptacle)
        9. cool an object using a receptacle
            :action CoolObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - fridgeReceptacle)
        10. slice an object using a sharp object
            :action SliceObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle ?co - object ?sharp_o - sharpObject)

        You must go to a receptacle first in order to use/open it or take/put objects from/on it.

        The process involves two main stages:

        1. Always searching for the aim Object first!!!
            In this stage, your goal is to go to and may need to open new, unvisited recepatacles until you find the object mentioned in the task. Some receptacles cannot be opened so you can directly see what objects after you go to that receptacle.

            You can only use the GotoLocation action to travel to a new location and the OpenObject action (if the receptacle is closed) to verify whether it contains the target object.

            Goal 1.1: Reach a location that has not been visited (the location should be a receptacle) using the GotoLocation action. 
                You goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (at ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be somewhere or some recepatacles not visited.

            Goal 1.2: If you already go to the recepatacle and found the recepatacle is closed, use the OpenObject action to open it and inspect the contents. 
                Your goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (opened ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be the recepatacle you want to open.

        2. After you seeing the aim object in any receptacle, using the Object to Complete the Task:
            After you have located the object (the object may have some numbers added), you should always first pick up the object from that receptacle and update your goal to focus on how the object is used to complete the task. Remember your goal is Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.. Based on different adjectives, you may need to perform different actions for the object in different ways.

            This may involve more than simply transferring it from one place to another.
            For example: You might examine the object or a nearby receptacle to gather information. You may need to use another tool or device (like a lamp or a switch). Some tasks require you to slice, heat, cool, or clean the object using an appropriate receptacle (e.g., microwave, sink, fridge).

            If necessary, use the PickupObject action to retrieve the item, and the GotoLocation action to move to the correct place.
            Then, apply the object in a purposeful way — not just move it — but interact with the environment to fulfill the task’s actual goal.

            Hint: 
            1. If you want to heat, clean, and cool an object, after you go to that aim receptacle, do not put the object in the receptacle but do the action directly. For example, go to fridge, then cool the object with receptacle.
            2. If you want to slice an object, you should first go to the receptacle where both the sharp object and the aim object are located and ONLY pick up the sharp object then do the slice action. Don't forget to put the sharp object back to the receptacle after you finish slicing.
            3. If you want to examine or look at an object with a lamp, you should first go to the receptacle where the object is located and then pick it up and take the USE action of the lamp. You don't need to take the lamp but directly use it.
            4. If there are multiple actions needed to complete the task, you can break them down into smaller subgoals. For example, if you need to slice and then heat an object, first focus on slicing it, and then move on to heating it.

        In summary, the first stage is all about finding the object—this might involve going to an unvisited receptacle and opening it if necessary.
        
        Note: 
        1. some receptacles have numbers in their names. Always keep them as they are. For example, "towelholder1" should not be changed to "towelholder".
        2. Your initial goal should always be to go to a new location instead of put something into somewhere.
        3. Do not enter stage 2 when not finishing stage 1.

        Note: Always include :negative-preconditions in your :requirements whenever you use (not …) or delete effects, and never leave an :precondition or :effect block empty—either omit it or include at least one literal.

        2. After you seeing the aim object in any receptacle, using the Object to Complete the Task:
            After you have located the object (the object may have some numbers added), you should always first pick up the object from that receptacle and update your goal to focus on how the object is used to complete the task. Remember your goal is Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.. Based on different adjectives, you may need to perform different actions for the object in different ways.

            This may involve more than simply transferring it from one place to another.
            For example: You might examine the object or a nearby receptacle to gather information. You may need to use another tool or device (like a lamp or a switch).

        Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
        The format should strictly be:

            "pf": "..."

        You are in an environment that you must explore step by step. Your task is to build and update PDDL files for the environment using only your direct observations. Do not create or assume any objects, relationships, or details that have not been observed, and ensure you include all observations.

        The environment is a room containing various objects. Some of these objects are on, in, or contained within other objects and receptacles. You will initially be located as init_receptacle. You can assume all receptacles are freely reachable.
        
        Now, Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.
        Here are your current observations: Action: go to cabinet 4
You arrive at cabinet 4. The cabinet 4 is closed.


        Only the following actions are allowed: (There are only two types: object and receptacle)
        1. go to a receptacle
            :action GotoLocation
            :parameters (?from - receptacle ?to - receptacle)
        2. open a receptacle if it is closed
            :action OpenObject

        3. close a receptacle
            :action CloseObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        4. take an object from another receptacle
            :action PickupObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        5. put object into/on/in another receptacle
            :action PutObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        6. using an object/receptacle by turning it on/off with a switch
            :action useObject
            :parameters (?o - object)
        7. heat an object using a receptacle
            :action HeatObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - microwaveReceptacle)
        8. clean an object using a receptacle
            :action CleanObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - sinkbasinReceptacle)
        9. cool an object using a receptacle
            :action CoolObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - fridgeReceptacle)
        10. slice an object using a sharp object
            :action SliceObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle ?co - object ?sharp_o - sharpObject)

        You must go to a receptacle first in order to use/open it or take/put objects from/on it.

        The process involves two main stages:

        1. Always searching for the aim Object first!!!
            In this stage, your goal is to go to and may need to open new, unvisited recepatacles until you find the object mentioned in the task. Some receptacles cannot be opened so you can directly see what objects after you go to that receptacle.

            You can only use the GotoLocation action to travel to a new location and the OpenObject action (if the receptacle is closed) to verify whether it contains the target object.

            Goal 1.1: Reach a location that has not been visited (the location should be a receptacle) using the GotoLocation action. 
                You goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (at ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be somewhere or some recepatacles not visited.

            Goal 1.2: If you already go to the recepatacle and found the recepatacle is closed, use the OpenObject action to open it and inspect the contents. 
                Your goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (opened ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be the recepatacle you want to open.

        2. After you seeing the aim object in any receptacle, using the Object to Complete the Task:
            After you have located the object (the object may have some numbers added), you should always first pick up the object from that receptacle and update your goal to focus on how the object is used to complete the task. Remember your goal is Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.. Based on different adjectives, you may need to perform different actions for the object in different ways.

            This may involve more than simply transferring it from one place to another.
            For example: You might examine the object or a nearby receptacle to gather information. You may need to use another tool or device (like a lamp or a switch). Some tasks require you to slice, heat, cool, or clean the object using an appropriate receptacle (e.g., microwave, sink, fridge).

            If necessary, use the PickupObject action to retrieve the item, and the GotoLocation action to move to the correct place.
            Then, apply the object in a purposeful way — not just move it — but interact with the environment to fulfill the task’s actual goal.

            Hint: 
            1. If you want to heat, clean, and cool an object, after you go to that aim receptacle, do not put the object in the receptacle but do the action directly. For example, go to fridge, then cool the object with receptacle.
            2. If you want to slice an object, you should first go to the receptacle where both the sharp object and the aim object are located and ONLY pick up the sharp object then do the slice action. Don't forget to put the sharp object back to the receptacle after you finish slicing.
            3. If you want to examine or look at an object with a lamp, you should first go to the receptacle where the object is located and then pick it up and take the USE action of the lamp. You don't need to take the lamp but directly use it.
            4. If there are multiple actions needed to complete the task, you can break them down into smaller subgoals. For example, if you need to slice and then heat an object, first focus on slicing it, and then move on to heating it.

        In summary, the first stage is all about finding the object—this might involve going to an unvisited receptacle and opening it if necessary.
        
        Note: 
        1. some receptacles have numbers in their names. Always keep them as they are. For example, "towelholder1" should not be changed to "towelholder".
        2. Your initial goal should always be to go to a new location instead of put something into somewhere.
        3. Do not enter stage 2 when not finishing stage 1.

        Note: Always include :negative-preconditions in your :requirements whenever you use (not …) or delete effects, and never leave an :precondition or :effect block empty—either omit it or include at least one literal.

        You must go to a receptacle first in order to use/open it or take/put objects from/on it.

        The process involves two main stages:

        1. Always searching for the aim Object first!!!
            In this stage, your goal is to go to and may need to open new, unvisited recepatacles until you find the object mentioned in the task. Some receptacles cannot be opened so you can directly see what objects after you go to that receptacle.

            You can only use the GotoLocation action to travel to a new location and the OpenObject action (if the receptacle is closed) to verify whether it contains the target object.

            Goal 1.1: Reach a location that has not been visited (the location should be a receptacle) using the GotoLocation action. 
                You goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (at ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be somewhere or some recepatacles not visited.

            Goal 1.2: If you already go to the recepatacle and found the recepatacle is closed, use the OpenObject action to open it and inspect the contents. 
                Your goal should look like this:

                    (opened ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be the recepatacle you want to open.

        2. After you seeing the aim object in any receptacle, using the Object to Complete the Task:
            After you have located the object (the object may have some numbers added), you should always first pick up the object from that receptacle and update your goal to focus on how the object is used to complete the task. Remember your goal is Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.. Based on different adjectives, you may need to perform different actions for the object in different ways.

            This may involve more than simply transferring it from one place to another.
            For example: You might examine the object or a nearby receptacle to gather information. You may need to use another tool or device (like a lamp or a switch). Some tasks require you to slice, heat, cool, or clean the object using an appropriate receptacle (e.g., microwave, sink, fridge).

            If necessary, use the PickupObject action to retrieve the item, and the GotoLocation action to move to the correct place.
            Then, apply the object in a purposeful way — not just move it — but interact with the environment to fulfill the task’s actual goal.

            Hint: 
            1. If you want to heat, clean, and cool an object, after you go to that aim receptacle, do not put the object in the receptacle but do the action directly. For example, go to fridge, then cool the object with receptacle.
            2. If you want to slice an object, you should first go to the receptacle where both the sharp object and the aim object are located and ONLY pick up the sharp object then do the slice action. Don't forget to put the sharp object back to the receptacle after you finish slicing.
            3. If you want to examine or look at an object with a lamp, you should first go to the receptacle where the object is located and then pick it up and take the USE action of the lamp. You don't need to take the lamp but directly use it.
            4. If there are multiple actions needed to complete the task, you can break them down into smaller subgoals. For example, if you need to slice and then heat an object, first focus on slicing it, and then move on to heating it.

        In summary, the first stage is all about finding the object—this might involve going to an unvisited receptacle and opening it if necessary.
        
        Note: 
        1. some receptacles have numbers in their names. Always keep them as they are. For example, "towelholder1" should not be changed to "towelholder".
        2. Your initial goal should always be to go to a new location instead of put something into somewhere.
        3. Do not enter stage 2 when not finishing stage 1.

        Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'.

Do not create or assume any objects, relationships, or details that have not been observed, and ensure you include all observations.

        The environment is a room containing various objects. Some of these objects are on, in, or contained within other objects and receptacles. You will initially be located as init_receptacle. You can assume all receptacles are freely reachable.
        
        Now, Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.
        Here are your current observations: Action: go to cabinet 3
You arrive at cabinet 3. The cabinet 3 is closed.


        Only the following actions are allowed: (There are only two types: object and receptacle)
        1. go to a receptacle
            :action GotoLocation
            :parameters (?from - receptacle ?to - receptacle)
        2. open a receptacle if it is closed

        3. close a receptacle
            :action CloseObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        4. take an object from another receptacle
            :action PickupObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        5. put object into/on/in another receptacle
            :action PutObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        6. using an object/receptacle by turning it on/off with a switch
            :action useObject
            :parameters (?o - object)
        7. heat an object using a receptacle
            :action HeatObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - microwaveReceptacle)
        8. clean an object using a receptacle
            :action CleanObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - sinkbasinReceptacle)
        9. cool an object using a receptacle
            :action CoolObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - fridgeReceptacle)
        10. slice an object using a sharp object
            :action SliceObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle ?co - object ?sharp_o - sharpObject)

        You must go to a receptacle first in order to use/open it or take/put objects from/on it.

        The process involves two main stages:

        1. Always searching for the aim Object first!!!
            In this stage, your goal is to go to and may need to open new, unvisited recepatacles until you find the object mentioned in the task. Some receptacles cannot be opened so you can directly see what objects after you go to that receptacle.

            You can only use the GotoLocation action to travel to a new location and the OpenObject action (if the receptacle is closed) to verify whether it contains the target object.

            Goal 1.1: Reach a location that has not been visited (the location should be a receptacle) using the GotoLocation action. 
                You goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (at ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be somewhere or some recepatacles not visited.

            Goal 1.2: If you already go to the recepatacle and found the recepatacle is closed, use the OpenObject action to open it and inspect the contents. 
                Your goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (opened ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be the recepatacle you want to open.

        2. After you seeing the aim object in any receptacle, using the Object to Complete the Task:
            After you have located the object (the object may have some numbers added), you should always first pick up the object from that receptacle and update your goal to focus on how the object is used to complete the task. Remember your goal is Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.. Based on different adjectives, you may need to perform different actions for the object in different ways.

            This may involve more than simply transferring it from one place to another.
            For example: You might examine the object or a nearby receptacle to gather information. You may need to use another tool or device (like a lamp or a switch). Some tasks require you to slice, heat, cool, or clean the object using an appropriate receptacle (e.g., microwave, sink, fridge).

            If necessary, use the PickupObject action to retrieve the item, and the GotoLocation action to move to the correct place.
            Then, apply the object in a purposeful way — not just move it — but interact with the environment to fulfill the task’s actual goal.

            Hint: 
            1. If you want to heat, clean, and cool an object, after you go to that aim receptacle, do not put the object in the receptacle but do the action directly. For example, go to fridge, then cool the object with receptacle.
            2. If you want to slice an object, you should first go to the receptacle where both the sharp object and the aim object are located and ONLY pick up the sharp object then do the slice action. Don't forget to put the sharp object back to the receptacle after you finish slicing.
            3. If you want to examine or look at an object with a lamp, you should first go to the receptacle where the object is located and then pick it up and take the USE action of the lamp. You don't need to take the lamp but directly use it.
            4. If there are multiple actions needed to complete the task, you can break them down into smaller subgoals. For example, if you need to slice and then heat an object, first focus on slicing it, and then move on to heating it.

        In summary, the first stage is all about finding the object—this might involve going to an unvisited receptacle and opening it if necessary.
        
        Note: 
        1. some receptacles have numbers in their names. Always keep them as they are. For example, "towelholder1" should not be changed to "towelholder".
        2. Your initial goal should always be to go to a new location instead of put something into somewhere.
        3. Do not enter stage 2 when not finishing stage 1.

        Note: Always include :negative-preconditions in your :requirements whenever you use (not …) or delete effects, and never leave an :precondition or :effect block empty—either omit it or include at least one literal.

            :action SliceObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle ?co - object ?sharp_o - sharpObject)

        You must go to a receptacle first in order to use/open it or take/put objects from/on it.

        The process involves two main stages:

        1. Always searching for the aim Object first!!!
            In this stage, your goal is to go to and may need to open new, unvisited recepatacles until you find the object mentioned in the task. Some receptacles cannot be opened so you can directly see what objects after you go to that receptacle.

            You can only use the GotoLocation action to travel to a new location and the OpenObject action (if the receptacle is closed) to verify whether it contains the target object.

            Goal 1.1: Reach a location that has not been visited (the location should be a receptacle) using the GotoLocation action. 
                You goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (at ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be somewhere or some recepatacles not visited.

            Goal 1.2: If you already go to the recepatacle and found the recepatacle is closed, use the OpenObject action to open it and inspect the contents. 
                Your goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (opened ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be the recepatacle you want to open.

        2. After you seeing the aim object in any receptacle, using the Object to Complete the Task:
            After you have located the object (the object may have some numbers added), you should always first pick up the object from that receptacle and update your goal to focus on how the object is used to complete the task. Remember your goal is Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.. Based on different adjectives, you may need to perform different actions for the object in different ways.

            This may involve more than simply transferring it from one place to another.
            For example: You might examine the object or a nearby receptacle to gather information. You may need to use another tool or device (like a lamp or a switch). Some tasks require you to slice, heat, cool, or clean the object using an appropriate receptacle (e.g., microwave, sink, fridge).

            If necessary, use the PickupObject action to retrieve the item, and the GotoLocation action to move to the correct place.
            Then, apply the object in a purposeful way — not just move it — but interact with the environment to fulfill the task’s actual goal.

            Hint: 
            1. If you want to heat, clean, and cool an object, after you go to that aim receptacle, do not put the object in the receptacle but do the action directly. For example, go to fridge, then cool the object with receptacle.
            2. If you want to slice an object, you should first go to the receptacle where both the sharp object and the aim object are located and ONLY pick up the sharp object then do the slice action. Don't forget to put the sharp object back to the receptacle after you finish slicing.
            3. If you want to examine or look at an object with a lamp, you should first go to the receptacle where the object is located and then pick it up and take the USE action of the lamp. You don't need to take the lamp but directly use it.
            4. If there are multiple actions needed to complete the task, you can break them down into smaller subgoals. For example, if you need to slice and then heat an object, first focus on slicing it, and then move on to heating it.

        In summary, the first stage is all about finding the object—this might involve going to an unvisited receptacle and opening it if necessary.
        
        Note: 
        1. some receptacles have numbers in their names. Always keep them as they are. For example, "towelholder1" should not be changed to "towelholder".
        2. Your initial goal should always be to go to a new location instead of put something into somewhere.
        3. Do not enter stage 2 when not finishing stage 1.

        Note: Always include :negative-preconditions in your :requirements whenever you use (not …) or delete effects, and never leave an :precondition or :effect block empty—either omit it or include at least one literal.

        Now, Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.
        Here are your current observations: Action: go to cabinet 2
You arrive at cabinet 2. The cabinet 2 is closed.


        Only the following actions are allowed: (There are only two types: object and receptacle)
        1. go to a receptacle
            :action GotoLocation
            :parameters (?from - receptacle ?to - receptacle)
        2. open a receptacle if it is closed
            :action OpenObject

        3. close a receptacle
            :action CloseObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        4. take an object from another receptacle
            :action PickupObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        5. put object into/on/in another receptacle
            :action PutObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        6. using an object/receptacle by turning it on/off with a switch
            :action useObject
            :parameters (?o - object)
        7. heat an object using a receptacle
            :action HeatObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - microwaveReceptacle)
        8. clean an object using a receptacle
            :action CleanObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - sinkbasinReceptacle)
        9. cool an object using a receptacle
            :action CoolObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - fridgeReceptacle)
        10. slice an object using a sharp object
            :action SliceObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle ?co - object ?sharp_o - sharpObject)

        You must go to a receptacle first in order to use/open it or take/put objects from/on it.

        The process involves two main stages:

        1. Always searching for the aim Object first!!!
            In this stage, your goal is to go to and may need to open new, unvisited recepatacles until you find the object mentioned in the task. Some receptacles cannot be opened so you can directly see what objects after you go to that receptacle.

            You can only use the GotoLocation action to travel to a new location and the OpenObject action (if the receptacle is closed) to verify whether it contains the target object.

            Goal 1.1: Reach a location that has not been visited (the location should be a receptacle) using the GotoLocation action. 
                You goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (at ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be somewhere or some recepatacles not visited.

            Goal 1.2: If you already go to the recepatacle and found the recepatacle is closed, use the OpenObject action to open it and inspect the contents. 
                Your goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (opened ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be the recepatacle you want to open.

        2. After you seeing the aim object in any receptacle, using the Object to Complete the Task:
            After you have located the object (the object may have some numbers added), you should always first pick up the object from that receptacle and update your goal to focus on how the object is used to complete the task. Remember your goal is Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.. Based on different adjectives, you may need to perform different actions for the object in different ways.

            This may involve more than simply transferring it from one place to another.
            For example: You might examine the object or a nearby receptacle to gather information. You may need to use another tool or device (like a lamp or a switch). Some tasks require you to slice, heat, cool, or clean the object using an appropriate receptacle (e.g., microwave, sink, fridge).

            If necessary, use the PickupObject action to retrieve the item, and the GotoLocation action to move to the correct place.
            Then, apply the object in a purposeful way — not just move it — but interact with the environment to fulfill the task’s actual goal.

            Hint: 
            1. If you want to heat, clean, and cool an object, after you go to that aim receptacle, do not put the object in the receptacle but do the action directly. For example, go to fridge, then cool the object with receptacle.
            2. If you want to slice an object, you should first go to the receptacle where both the sharp object and the aim object are located and ONLY pick up the sharp object then do the slice action. Don't forget to put the sharp object back to the receptacle after you finish slicing.
            3. If you want to examine or look at an object with a lamp, you should first go to the receptacle where the object is located and then pick it up and take the USE action of the lamp. You don't need to take the lamp but directly use it.
            4. If there are multiple actions needed to complete the task, you can break them down into smaller subgoals. For example, if you need to slice and then heat an object, first focus on slicing it, and then move on to heating it.

        In summary, the first stage is all about finding the object—this might involve going to an unvisited receptacle and opening it if necessary.
        
        Note: 
        1. some receptacles have numbers in their names. Always keep them as they are. For example, "towelholder1" should not be changed to "towelholder".
        2. Your initial goal should always be to go to a new location instead of put something into somewhere.
        3. Do not enter stage 2 when not finishing stage 1.

        Note: Always include :negative-preconditions in your :requirements whenever you use (not …) or delete effects, and never leave an :precondition or :effect block empty—either omit it or include at least one literal.

        Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
        The format should strictly be:

            "df": "...",
            "pf": "..."
            }
    
        You are in an environment that you must explore step by step. Your task is to build and update PDDL files for the environment using only your direct observations. Do not create or assume any objects, relationships, or details that have not been observed, and ensure you include all observations.

        The environment is a room containing various objects. Some of these objects are on, in, or contained within other objects and receptacles. You will initially be located as init_receptacle. You can assume all receptacles are freely reachable.
        
        Now, Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.
        Here are your current observations: Action: open cabinet 2
You open the cabinet 2. The cabinet 2 is open. In it, you see a soapbottle 1.


        Only the following actions are allowed: (There are only two types: object and receptacle)
        1. go to a receptacle
            :action GotoLocation
            :parameters (?from - receptacle ?to - receptacle)
        2. open a receptacle if it is closed
            :action OpenObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        3. close a receptacle
            :action CloseObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        4. take an object from another receptacle
            :action PickupObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        5. put object into/on/in another receptacle
            :action PutObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        6. using an object/receptacle by turning it on/off with a switch
            :action useObject
            :parameters (?o - object)
        7. heat an object using a receptacle
            :action HeatObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - microwaveReceptacle)
        8. clean an object using a receptacle
            :action CleanObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - sinkbasinReceptacle)
        9. cool an object using a receptacle
            :action CoolObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - fridgeReceptacle)
        10. slice an object using a sharp object
            :action SliceObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle ?co - object ?sharp_o - sharpObject)

        You must go to a receptacle first in order to use/open it or take/put objects from/on it.

        The process involves two main stages:

        1. Always searching for the aim Object first!!!
            In this stage, your goal is to go to and may need to open new, unvisited recepatacles until you find the object mentioned in the task. Some receptacles cannot be opened so you can directly see what objects after you go to that receptacle.

            You can only use the GotoLocation action to travel to a new location and the OpenObject action (if the receptacle is closed) to verify whether it contains the target object.

            Goal 1.1: Reach a location that has not been visited (the location should be a receptacle) using the GotoLocation action. 
                You goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (at ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be somewhere or some recepatacles not visited.

            Goal 1.2: If you already go to the recepatacle and found the recepatacle is closed, use the OpenObject action to open it and inspect the contents. 
                Your goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (opened ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be the recepatacle you want to open.

        2. After you seeing the aim object in any receptacle, using the Object to Complete the Task:
            After you have located the object (the object may have some numbers added), you should always first pick up the object from that receptacle and update your goal to focus on how the object is used to complete the task. Remember your goal is Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.. Based on different adjectives, you may need to perform different actions for the object in different ways.

            This may involve more than simply transferring it from one place to another.
            For example: You might examine the object or a nearby receptacle to gather information. You may need to use another tool or device (like a lamp or a switch). Some tasks require you to slice, heat, cool, or clean the object using an appropriate receptacle (e.g., microwave, sink, fridge).

            If necessary, use the PickupObject action to retrieve the item, and the GotoLocation action to move to the correct place.
            Then, apply the object in a purposeful way — not just move it — but interact with the environment to fulfill the task’s actual goal.

            Hint: 
            1. If you want to heat, clean, and cool an object, after you go to that aim receptacle, do not put the object in the receptacle but do the action directly. For example, go to fridge, then cool the object with receptacle.
            2. If you want to slice an object, you should first go to the receptacle where both the sharp object and the aim object are located and ONLY pick up the sharp object then do the slice action. Don't forget to put the sharp object back to the receptacle after you finish slicing.
            3. If you want to examine or look at an object with a lamp, you should first go to the receptacle where the object is located and then pick it up and take the USE action of the lamp. You don't need to take the lamp but directly use it.
            4. If there are multiple actions needed to complete the task, you can break them down into smaller subgoals. For example, if you need to slice and then heat an object, first focus on slicing it, and then move on to heating it.

        In summary, the first stage is all about finding the object—this might involve going to an unvisited receptacle and opening it if necessary.
        
        Note: 
        1. some receptacles have numbers in their names. Always keep them as they are. For example, "towelholder1" should not be changed to "towelholder".
        2. Your initial goal should always be to go to a new location instead of put something into somewhere.
        3. Do not enter stage 2 when not finishing stage 1.

        Note: Always include :negative-preconditions in your :requirements whenever you use (not …) or delete effects, and never leave an :precondition or :effect block empty—either omit it or include at least one literal.

        You must go to a receptacle first in order to use/open it or take/put objects from/on it.

        The process involves two main stages:

        1. Always searching for the aim Object first!!!
            In this stage, your goal is to go to and may need to open new, unvisited recepatacles until you find the object mentioned in the task. Some receptacles cannot be opened so you can directly see what objects after you go to that receptacle.

            You can only use the GotoLocation action to travel to a new location and the OpenObject action (if the receptacle is closed) to verify whether it contains the target object.

            Goal 1.1: Reach a location that has not been visited (the location should be a receptacle) using the GotoLocation action. 
                You goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (at ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be somewhere or some recepatacles not visited.

            Goal 1.2: If you already go to the recepatacle and found the recepatacle is closed, use the OpenObject action to open it and inspect the contents. 
                Your goal should look like this:

                    (opened ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be the recepatacle you want to open.

        2. After you seeing the aim object in any receptacle, using the Object to Complete the Task:
            After you have located the object (the object may have some numbers added), you should always first pick up the object from that receptacle and update your goal to focus on how the object is used to complete the task. Remember your goal is Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.. Based on different adjectives, you may need to perform different actions for the object in different ways.

            This may involve more than simply transferring it from one place to another.
            For example: You might examine the object or a nearby receptacle to gather information. You may need to use another tool or device (like a lamp or a switch). Some tasks require you to slice, heat, cool, or clean the object using an appropriate receptacle (e.g., microwave, sink, fridge).

            If necessary, use the PickupObject action to retrieve the item, and the GotoLocation action to move to the correct place.
            Then, apply the object in a purposeful way — not just move it — but interact with the environment to fulfill the task’s actual goal.

            Hint: 
            1. If you want to heat, clean, and cool an object, after you go to that aim receptacle, do not put the object in the receptacle but do the action directly. For example, go to fridge, then cool the object with receptacle.
            2. If you want to slice an object, you should first go to the receptacle where both the sharp object and the aim object are located and ONLY pick up the sharp object then do the slice action. Don't forget to put the sharp object back to the receptacle after you finish slicing.
            3. If you want to examine or look at an object with a lamp, you should first go to the receptacle where the object is located and then pick it up and take the USE action of the lamp. You don't need to take the lamp but directly use it.
            4. If there are multiple actions needed to complete the task, you can break them down into smaller subgoals. For example, if you need to slice and then heat an object, first focus on slicing it, and then move on to heating it.

        In summary, the first stage is all about finding the object—this might involve going to an unvisited receptacle and opening it if necessary.
        
        Note: 
        1. some receptacles have numbers in their names. Always keep them as they are. For example, "towelholder1" should not be changed to "towelholder".

Prompt: 
        Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
        The format should strictly be:

            "pf": "..."
            }
    
        You are in an environment that you must explore step by step. Your task is to build and update PDDL files for the environment using only your direct observations. Do not create or assume any objects, relationships, or details that have not been observed, and ensure you include all observations.

        The environment is a room containing various objects. Some of these objects are on, in, or contained within other objects and receptacles. You will initially be located as init_receptacle. You can assume all receptacles are freely reachable.
        
        Now, Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.
        Here are your current observations: Action: open cabinet 1
You open the cabinet 1. The cabinet 1 is open. In it, you see nothing.


        Only the following actions are allowed: (There are only two types: object and receptacle)
        1. go to a receptacle
            :action GotoLocation
            :parameters (?from - receptacle ?to - receptacle)
        2. open a receptacle if it is closed
            :action OpenObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        3. close a receptacle
            :action CloseObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        4. take an object from another receptacle
            :action PickupObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        5. put object into/on/in another receptacle
            :action PutObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        6. using an object/receptacle by turning it on/off with a switch
            :action useObject
            :parameters (?o - object)
        7. heat an object using a receptacle
            :action HeatObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - microwaveReceptacle)
        8. clean an object using a receptacle
            :action CleanObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - sinkbasinReceptacle)
        9. cool an object using a receptacle
            :action CoolObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - fridgeReceptacle)
        10. slice an object using a sharp object
            :action SliceObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle ?co - object ?sharp_o - sharpObject)

        You must go to a receptacle first in order to use/open it or take/put objects from/on it.

        The process involves two main stages:

        1. Always searching for the aim Object first!!!
            In this stage, your goal is to go to and may need to open new, unvisited recepatacles until you find the object mentioned in the task. Some receptacles cannot be opened so you can directly see what objects after you go to that receptacle.

            You can only use the GotoLocation action to travel to a new location and the OpenObject action (if the receptacle is closed) to verify whether it contains the target object.

            Goal 1.1: Reach a location that has not been visited (the location should be a receptacle) using the GotoLocation action. 
                You goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (at ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be somewhere or some recepatacles not visited.

            Goal 1.2: If you already go to the recepatacle and found the recepatacle is closed, use the OpenObject action to open it and inspect the contents. 
                Your goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (opened ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be the recepatacle you want to open.

        2. After you seeing the aim object in any receptacle, using the Object to Complete the Task:
            After you have located the object (the object may have some numbers added), you should always first pick up the object from that receptacle and update your goal to focus on how the object is used to complete the task. Remember your goal is Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.. Based on different adjectives, you may need to perform different actions for the object in different ways.

            This may involve more than simply transferring it from one place to another.
            For example: You might examine the object or a nearby receptacle to gather information. You may need to use another tool or device (like a lamp or a switch). Some tasks require you to slice, heat, cool, or clean the object using an appropriate receptacle (e.g., microwave, sink, fridge).

            If necessary, use the PickupObject action to retrieve the item, and the GotoLocation action to move to the correct place.
            Then, apply the object in a purposeful way — not just move it — but interact with the environment to fulfill the task’s actual goal.

            Hint: 
            1. If you want to heat, clean, and cool an object, after you go to that aim receptacle, do not put the object in the receptacle but do the action directly. For example, go to fridge, then cool the object with receptacle.
            2. If you want to slice an object, you should first go to the receptacle where both the sharp object and the aim object are located and ONLY pick up the sharp object then do the slice action. Don't forget to put the sharp object back to the receptacle after you finish slicing.
            3. If you want to examine or look at an object with a lamp, you should first go to the receptacle where the object is located and then pick it up and take the USE action of the lamp. You don't need to take the lamp but directly use it.
            4. If there are multiple actions needed to complete the task, you can break them down into smaller subgoals. For example, if you need to slice and then heat an object, first focus on slicing it, and then move on to heating it.

        In summary, the first stage is all about finding the object—this might involve going to an unvisited receptacle and opening it if necessary.
        
        Note: 
        1. some receptacles have numbers in their names. Always keep them as they are. For example, "towelholder1" should not be changed to "towelholder".
        2. Your initial goal should always be to go to a new location instead of put something into somewhere.
        3. Do not enter stage 2 when not finishing stage 1.

        Note: Always include :negative-preconditions in your :requirements whenever you use (not …) or delete effects, and never leave an :precondition or :effect block empty—either omit it or include at least one literal.

        You are in an environment that you must explore step by step. Your task is to build and update PDDL files for the environment using only your direct observations. Do not create or assume any objects, relationships, or details that have not been observed, and ensure you include all observations.

        The environment is a room containing various objects. Some of these objects are on, in, or contained within other objects and receptacles. You will initially be located as init_receptacle. You can assume all receptacles are freely reachable.
        
        Now, Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.
        Here are your current observations: Action: go to countertop 1
You arrive at countertop 1. On the countertop 1, you see a spraybottle 2.


        Only the following actions are allowed: (There are only two types: object and receptacle)
        1. go to a receptacle
            :action GotoLocation
            :parameters (?from - receptacle ?to - receptacle)
        2. open a receptacle if it is closed
            :action OpenObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        3. close a receptacle
            :action CloseObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        4. take an object from another receptacle
            :action PickupObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        5. put object into/on/in another receptacle
            :action PutObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        6. using an object/receptacle by turning it on/off with a switch
            :action useObject
            :parameters (?o - object)
        7. heat an object using a receptacle
            :action HeatObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - microwaveReceptacle)
        8. clean an object using a receptacle
            :action CleanObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - sinkbasinReceptacle)
        9. cool an object using a receptacle
            :action CoolObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - fridgeReceptacle)
        10. slice an object using a sharp object
            :action SliceObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle ?co - object ?sharp_o - sharpObject)

        You must go to a receptacle first in order to use/open it or take/put objects from/on it.

        The process involves two main stages:

        1. Always searching for the aim Object first!!!
            In this stage, your goal is to go to and may need to open new, unvisited recepatacles until you find the object mentioned in the task. Some receptacles cannot be opened so you can directly see what objects after you go to that receptacle.

            You can only use the GotoLocation action to travel to a new location and the OpenObject action (if the receptacle is closed) to verify whether it contains the target object.

            Goal 1.1: Reach a location that has not been visited (the location should be a receptacle) using the GotoLocation action. 
                You goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (at ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be somewhere or some recepatacles not visited.

            Goal 1.2: If you already go to the recepatacle and found the recepatacle is closed, use the OpenObject action to open it and inspect the contents. 
                Your goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (opened ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be the recepatacle you want to open.

        2. After you seeing the aim object in any receptacle, using the Object to Complete the Task:
            After you have located the object (the object may have some numbers added), you should always first pick up the object from that receptacle and update your goal to focus on how the object is used to complete the task. Remember your goal is Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.. Based on different adjectives, you may need to perform different actions for the object in different ways.

            This may involve more than simply transferring it from one place to another.
            For example: You might examine the object or a nearby receptacle to gather information. You may need to use another tool or device (like a lamp or a switch). Some tasks require you to slice, heat, cool, or clean the object using an appropriate receptacle (e.g., microwave, sink, fridge).

            If necessary, use the PickupObject action to retrieve the item, and the GotoLocation action to move to the correct place.
            Then, apply the object in a purposeful way — not just move it — but interact with the environment to fulfill the task’s actual goal.

            Hint: 
            1. If you want to heat, clean, and cool an object, after you go to that aim receptacle, do not put the object in the receptacle but do the action directly. For example, go to fridge, then cool the object with receptacle.
            2. If you want to slice an object, you should first go to the receptacle where both the sharp object and the aim object are located and ONLY pick up the sharp object then do the slice action. Don't forget to put the sharp object back to the receptacle after you finish slicing.
            3. If you want to examine or look at an object with a lamp, you should first go to the receptacle where the object is located and then pick it up and take the USE action of the lamp. You don't need to take the lamp but directly use it.
            4. If there are multiple actions needed to complete the task, you can break them down into smaller subgoals. For example, if you need to slice and then heat an object, first focus on slicing it, and then move on to heating it.

        In summary, the first stage is all about finding the object—this might involve going to an unvisited receptacle and opening it if necessary.
        
        Note: 
        1. some receptacles have numbers in their names. Always keep them as they are. For example, "towelholder1" should not be changed to "towelholder".
        2. Your initial goal should always be to go to a new location instead of put something into somewhere.
        3. Do not enter stage 2 when not finishing stage 1.

        Note: Always include :negative-preconditions in your :requirements whenever you use (not …) or delete effects, and never leave an :precondition or :effect block empty—either omit it or include at least one literal.

        8. clean an object using a receptacle

        9. cool an object using a receptacle
            :action CoolObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - fridgeReceptacle)
        10. slice an object using a sharp object
            :action SliceObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle ?co - object ?sharp_o - sharpObject)

        You must go to a receptacle first in order to use/open it or take/put objects from/on it.

        The process involves two main stages:

        1. Always searching for the aim Object first!!!
            In this stage, your goal is to go to and may need to open new, unvisited recepatacles until you find the object mentioned in the task. Some receptacles cannot be opened so you can directly see what objects after you go to that receptacle.

            You can only use the GotoLocation action to travel to a new location and the OpenObject action (if the receptacle is closed) to verify whether it contains the target object.

            Goal 1.1: Reach a location that has not been visited (the location should be a receptacle) using the GotoLocation action. 
                You goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (at ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be somewhere or some recepatacles not visited.

            Goal 1.2: If you already go to the recepatacle and found the recepatacle is closed, use the OpenObject action to open it and inspect the contents. 
                Your goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (opened ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be the recepatacle you want to open.

        2. After you seeing the aim object in any receptacle, using the Object to Complete the Task:
            After you have located the object (the object may have some numbers added), you should always first pick up the object from that receptacle and update your goal to focus on how the object is used to complete the task. Remember your goal is Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.. Based on different adjectives, you may need to perform different actions for the object in different ways.

            This may involve more than simply transferring it from one place to another.
            For example: You might examine the object or a nearby receptacle to gather information. You may need to use another tool or device (like a lamp or a switch). Some tasks require you to slice, heat, cool, or clean the object using an appropriate receptacle (e.g., microwave, sink, fridge).

            If necessary, use the PickupObject action to retrieve the item, and the GotoLocation action to move to the correct place.
            Then, apply the object in a purposeful way — not just move it — but interact with the environment to fulfill the task’s actual goal.

            Hint: 
            1. If you want to heat, clean, and cool an object, after you go to that aim receptacle, do not put the object in the receptacle but do the action directly. For example, go to fridge, then cool the object with receptacle.
            2. If you want to slice an object, you should first go to the receptacle where both the sharp object and the aim object are located and ONLY pick up the sharp object then do the slice action. Don't forget to put the sharp object back to the receptacle after you finish slicing.
            3. If you want to examine or look at an object with a lamp, you should first go to the receptacle where the object is located and then pick it up and take the USE action of the lamp. You don't need to take the lamp but directly use it.
            4. If there are multiple actions needed to complete the task, you can break them down into smaller subgoals. For example, if you need to slice and then heat an object, first focus on slicing it, and then move on to heating it.

        In summary, the first stage is all about finding the object—this might involve going to an unvisited receptacle and opening it if necessary.
        
        Note: 
        1. some receptacles have numbers in their names. Always keep them as they are. For example, "towelholder1" should not be changed to "towelholder".
        2. Your initial goal should always be to go to a new location instead of put something into somewhere.
        3. Do not enter stage 2 when not finishing stage 1.

        Note: Always include :negative-preconditions in your :requirements whenever you use (not …) or delete effects, and never leave an :precondition or :effect block empty—either omit it or include at least one literal.

            :parameters (?r - receptacle ?co - object ?sharp_o - sharpObject)

        You must go to a receptacle first in order to use/open it or take/put objects from/on it.

        The process involves two main stages:

        1. Always searching for the aim Object first!!!
            In this stage, your goal is to go to and may need to open new, unvisited recepatacles until you find the object mentioned in the task. Some receptacles cannot be opened so you can directly see what objects after you go to that receptacle.

            You can only use the GotoLocation action to travel to a new location and the OpenObject action (if the receptacle is closed) to verify whether it contains the target object.

            Goal 1.1: Reach a location that has not been visited (the location should be a receptacle) using the GotoLocation action. 
                You goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (at ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be somewhere or some recepatacles not visited.

            Goal 1.2: If you already go to the recepatacle and found the recepatacle is closed, use the OpenObject action to open it and inspect the contents. 
                Your goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (opened ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be the recepatacle you want to open.

        2. After you seeing the aim object in any receptacle, using the Object to Complete the Task:
            After you have located the object (the object may have some numbers added), you should always first pick up the object from that receptacle and update your goal to focus on how the object is used to complete the task. Remember your goal is Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.. Based on different adjectives, you may need to perform different actions for the object in different ways.

            This may involve more than simply transferring it from one place to another.
            For example: You might examine the object or a nearby receptacle to gather information. You may need to use another tool or device (like a lamp or a switch). Some tasks require you to slice, heat, cool, or clean the object using an appropriate receptacle (e.g., microwave, sink, fridge).

            If necessary, use the PickupObject action to retrieve the item, and the GotoLocation action to move to the correct place.
            Then, apply the object in a purposeful way — not just move it — but interact with the environment to fulfill the task’s actual goal.

            Hint: 
            1. If you want to heat, clean, and cool an object, after you go to that aim receptacle, do not put the object in the receptacle but do the action directly. For example, go to fridge, then cool the object with receptacle.
            2. If you want to slice an object, you should first go to the receptacle where both the sharp object and the aim object are located and ONLY pick up the sharp object then do the slice action. Don't forget to put the sharp object back to the receptacle after you finish slicing.
            3. If you want to examine or look at an object with a lamp, you should first go to the receptacle where the object is located and then pick it up and take the USE action of the lamp. You don't need to take the lamp but directly use it.
            4. If there are multiple actions needed to complete the task, you can break them down into smaller subgoals. For example, if you need to slice and then heat an object, first focus on slicing it, and then move on to heating it.

        In summary, the first stage is all about finding the object—this might involve going to an unvisited receptacle and opening it if necessary.
        
        Note: 
        1. some receptacles have numbers in their names. Always keep them as they are. For example, "towelholder1" should not be changed to "towelholder".
        2. Your initial goal should always be to go to a new location instead of put something into somewhere.
        3. Do not enter stage 2 when not finishing stage 1.

        Note: Always include :negative-preconditions in your :requirements whenever you use (not …) or delete effects, and never leave an :precondition or :effect block empty—either omit it or include at least one literal.

        Now modify those two files according to the new observations and notes. Fix any errors you made in the previous setting according to the new observation.
        Generate updated files based on your new observation.
    
        You have already generate files according to the observations. The df and pf can generate actions but after simulating,
        it got those errors: In this step, you take the following actions and observations from those actions:
                                    Action: go to dresser 1
Nothing happens.
This is the action you take and got something wrong: go to dresser 1. You are trying to go to a receptacle but nothing happens. 
                                        You may already been at this receptacle, in other words, you have already went to this place and do not need to go to this receptacle again.
                                        Otherwise, there is no the receptacle you are aiming to.. Please review both files and fix them.
        Now modify those two files according to the error message.

        The format should strictly be:

            "pf": "..."
            }
    
        You are in an environment that you must explore step by step. Your task is to build and update PDDL files for the environment using only your direct observations. Do not create or assume any objects, relationships, or details that have not been observed, and ensure you include all observations.

        The environment is a room containing various objects. Some of these objects are on, in, or contained within other objects and receptacles. You will initially be located as init_receptacle. You can assume all receptacles are freely reachable.
        
        Now, Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.
        Here are your current observations: Action: go to dresser 1
You arrive at dresser 1. On the dresser 1, you see a spraybottle 1, and a toiletpaper 2.


        Only the following actions are allowed: (There are only two types: object and receptacle)
        1. go to a receptacle
            :action GotoLocation
            :parameters (?from - receptacle ?to - receptacle)
        2. open a receptacle if it is closed
            :action OpenObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        3. close a receptacle
            :action CloseObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        4. take an object from another receptacle
            :action PickupObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        5. put object into/on/in another receptacle
            :action PutObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        6. using an object/receptacle by turning it on/off with a switch
            :action useObject
            :parameters (?o - object)
        7. heat an object using a receptacle
            :action HeatObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - microwaveReceptacle)
        8. clean an object using a receptacle
            :action CleanObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - sinkbasinReceptacle)
        9. cool an object using a receptacle
            :action CoolObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - fridgeReceptacle)
        10. slice an object using a sharp object
            :action SliceObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle ?co - object ?sharp_o - sharpObject)

        You must go to a receptacle first in order to use/open it or take/put objects from/on it.

        The process involves two main stages:

        1. Always searching for the aim Object first!!!
            In this stage, your goal is to go to and may need to open new, unvisited recepatacles until you find the object mentioned in the task. Some receptacles cannot be opened so you can directly see what objects after you go to that receptacle.

            You can only use the GotoLocation action to travel to a new location and the OpenObject action (if the receptacle is closed) to verify whether it contains the target object.

            Goal 1.1: Reach a location that has not been visited (the location should be a receptacle) using the GotoLocation action. 
                You goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (at ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be somewhere or some recepatacles not visited.

            Goal 1.2: If you already go to the recepatacle and found the recepatacle is closed, use the OpenObject action to open it and inspect the contents. 
                Your goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (opened ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be the recepatacle you want to open.

        2. After you seeing the aim object in any receptacle, using the Object to Complete the Task:
            After you have located the object (the object may have some numbers added), you should always first pick up the object from that receptacle and update your goal to focus on how the object is used to complete the task. Remember your goal is Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.. Based on different adjectives, you may need to perform different actions for the object in different ways.

            This may involve more than simply transferring it from one place to another.
            For example: You might examine the object or a nearby receptacle to gather information. You may need to use another tool or device (like a lamp or a switch). Some tasks require you to slice, heat, cool, or clean the object using an appropriate receptacle (e.g., microwave, sink, fridge).

            If necessary, use the PickupObject action to retrieve the item, and the GotoLocation action to move to the correct place.
            Then, apply the object in a purposeful way — not just move it — but interact with the environment to fulfill the task’s actual goal.

            Hint: 
            1. If you want to heat, clean, and cool an object, after you go to that aim receptacle, do not put the object in the receptacle but do the action directly. For example, go to fridge, then cool the object with receptacle.
            2. If you want to slice an object, you should first go to the receptacle where both the sharp object and the aim object are located and ONLY pick up the sharp object then do the slice action. Don't forget to put the sharp object back to the receptacle after you finish slicing.
            3. If you want to examine or look at an object with a lamp, you should first go to the receptacle where the object is located and then pick it up and take the USE action of the lamp. You don't need to take the lamp but directly use it.
            4. If there are multiple actions needed to complete the task, you can break them down into smaller subgoals. For example, if you need to slice and then heat an object, first focus on slicing it, and then move on to heating it.

        In summary, the first stage is all about finding the object—this might involve going to an unvisited receptacle and opening it if necessary.
        
        Note: 
        1. some receptacles have numbers in their names. Always keep them as they are. For example, "towelholder1" should not be changed to "towelholder".
        2. Your initial goal should always be to go to a new location instead of put something into somewhere.
        3. Do not enter stage 2 when not finishing stage 1.

        Note: Always include :negative-preconditions in your :requirements whenever you use (not …) or delete effects, and never leave an :precondition or :effect block empty—either omit it or include at least one literal.

        The environment is a room containing various objects. Some of these objects are on, in, or contained within other objects and receptacles. You will initially be located as init_receptacle. You can assume all receptacles are freely reachable.
        
        Now, Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.
        Here are your current observations: Action: go to handtowelholder 1
You arrive at handtowelholder 1. On the handtowelholder 1, you see a handtowel 1.


        Only the following actions are allowed: (There are only two types: object and receptacle)
        1. go to a receptacle
            :action GotoLocation
            :parameters (?from - receptacle ?to - receptacle)
        2. open a receptacle if it is closed
            :action OpenObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        3. close a receptacle
            :action CloseObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        4. take an object from another receptacle
            :action PickupObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        5. put object into/on/in another receptacle
            :action PutObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        6. using an object/receptacle by turning it on/off with a switch
            :action useObject
            :parameters (?o - object)
        7. heat an object using a receptacle
            :action HeatObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - microwaveReceptacle)
        8. clean an object using a receptacle
            :action CleanObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - sinkbasinReceptacle)
        9. cool an object using a receptacle
            :action CoolObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - fridgeReceptacle)
        10. slice an object using a sharp object
            :action SliceObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle ?co - object ?sharp_o - sharpObject)

        You must go to a receptacle first in order to use/open it or take/put objects from/on it.

        The process involves two main stages:

        1. Always searching for the aim Object first!!!
            In this stage, your goal is to go to and may need to open new, unvisited recepatacles until you find the object mentioned in the task. Some receptacles cannot be opened so you can directly see what objects after you go to that receptacle.

            You can only use the GotoLocation action to travel to a new location and the OpenObject action (if the receptacle is closed) to verify whether it contains the target object.

            Goal 1.1: Reach a location that has not been visited (the location should be a receptacle) using the GotoLocation action. 
                You goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (at ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be somewhere or some recepatacles not visited.

            Goal 1.2: If you already go to the recepatacle and found the recepatacle is closed, use the OpenObject action to open it and inspect the contents. 
                Your goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (opened ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be the recepatacle you want to open.

        2. After you seeing the aim object in any receptacle, using the Object to Complete the Task:
            After you have located the object (the object may have some numbers added), you should always first pick up the object from that receptacle and update your goal to focus on how the object is used to complete the task. Remember your goal is Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.. Based on different adjectives, you may need to perform different actions for the object in different ways.

            This may involve more than simply transferring it from one place to another.
            For example: You might examine the object or a nearby receptacle to gather information. You may need to use another tool or device (like a lamp or a switch). Some tasks require you to slice, heat, cool, or clean the object using an appropriate receptacle (e.g., microwave, sink, fridge).

            If necessary, use the PickupObject action to retrieve the item, and the GotoLocation action to move to the correct place.
            Then, apply the object in a purposeful way — not just move it — but interact with the environment to fulfill the task’s actual goal.

            Hint: 
            1. If you want to heat, clean, and cool an object, after you go to that aim receptacle, do not put the object in the receptacle but do the action directly. For example, go to fridge, then cool the object with receptacle.
            2. If you want to slice an object, you should first go to the receptacle where both the sharp object and the aim object are located and ONLY pick up the sharp object then do the slice action. Don't forget to put the sharp object back to the receptacle after you finish slicing.
            3. If you want to examine or look at an object with a lamp, you should first go to the receptacle where the object is located and then pick it up and take the USE action of the lamp. You don't need to take the lamp but directly use it.
            4. If there are multiple actions needed to complete the task, you can break them down into smaller subgoals. For example, if you need to slice and then heat an object, first focus on slicing it, and then move on to heating it.

        In summary, the first stage is all about finding the object—this might involve going to an unvisited receptacle and opening it if necessary.
        
        Note: 
        1. some receptacles have numbers in their names. Always keep them as they are. For example, "towelholder1" should not be changed to "towelholder".
        2. Your initial goal should always be to go to a new location instead of put something into somewhere.
        3. Do not enter stage 2 when not finishing stage 1.

        Note: Always include :negative-preconditions in your :requirements whenever you use (not …) or delete effects, and never leave an :precondition or :effect block empty—either omit it or include at least one literal.

        You are in an environment that you must explore step by step. Your task is to build and update PDDL files for the environment using only your direct observations. Do not create or assume any objects, relationships, or details that have not been observed, and ensure you include all observations.

        The environment is a room containing various objects. Some of these objects are on, in, or contained within other objects and receptacles. You will initially be located as init_receptacle. You can assume all receptacles are freely reachable.
        
        Now, Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.
        Here are your current observations: Action: go to drawer 2
Nothing happens.


        Only the following actions are allowed: (There are only two types: object and receptacle)
        1. go to a receptacle
            :action GotoLocation
            :parameters (?from - receptacle ?to - receptacle)
        2. open a receptacle if it is closed
            :action OpenObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        3. close a receptacle
            :action CloseObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        4. take an object from another receptacle
            :action PickupObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        5. put object into/on/in another receptacle
            :action PutObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        6. using an object/receptacle by turning it on/off with a switch
            :action useObject
            :parameters (?o - object)
        7. heat an object using a receptacle
            :action HeatObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - microwaveReceptacle)
        8. clean an object using a receptacle
            :action CleanObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - sinkbasinReceptacle)
        9. cool an object using a receptacle
            :action CoolObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - fridgeReceptacle)
        10. slice an object using a sharp object
            :action SliceObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle ?co - object ?sharp_o - sharpObject)

        You must go to a receptacle first in order to use/open it or take/put objects from/on it.

        The process involves two main stages:

        1. Always searching for the aim Object first!!!
            In this stage, your goal is to go to and may need to open new, unvisited recepatacles until you find the object mentioned in the task. Some receptacles cannot be opened so you can directly see what objects after you go to that receptacle.

            You can only use the GotoLocation action to travel to a new location and the OpenObject action (if the receptacle is closed) to verify whether it contains the target object.

            Goal 1.1: Reach a location that has not been visited (the location should be a receptacle) using the GotoLocation action. 
                You goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (at ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be somewhere or some recepatacles not visited.

            Goal 1.2: If you already go to the recepatacle and found the recepatacle is closed, use the OpenObject action to open it and inspect the contents. 
                Your goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (opened ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be the recepatacle you want to open.

        2. After you seeing the aim object in any receptacle, using the Object to Complete the Task:
            After you have located the object (the object may have some numbers added), you should always first pick up the object from that receptacle and update your goal to focus on how the object is used to complete the task. Remember your goal is Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.. Based on different adjectives, you may need to perform different actions for the object in different ways.

            This may involve more than simply transferring it from one place to another.
            For example: You might examine the object or a nearby receptacle to gather information. You may need to use another tool or device (like a lamp or a switch). Some tasks require you to slice, heat, cool, or clean the object using an appropriate receptacle (e.g., microwave, sink, fridge).

            If necessary, use the PickupObject action to retrieve the item, and the GotoLocation action to move to the correct place.
            Then, apply the object in a purposeful way — not just move it — but interact with the environment to fulfill the task’s actual goal.

            Hint: 
            1. If you want to heat, clean, and cool an object, after you go to that aim receptacle, do not put the object in the receptacle but do the action directly. For example, go to fridge, then cool the object with receptacle.
            2. If you want to slice an object, you should first go to the receptacle where both the sharp object and the aim object are located and ONLY pick up the sharp object then do the slice action. Don't forget to put the sharp object back to the receptacle after you finish slicing.
            3. If you want to examine or look at an object with a lamp, you should first go to the receptacle where the object is located and then pick it up and take the USE action of the lamp. You don't need to take the lamp but directly use it.
            4. If there are multiple actions needed to complete the task, you can break them down into smaller subgoals. For example, if you need to slice and then heat an object, first focus on slicing it, and then move on to heating it.

        In summary, the first stage is all about finding the object—this might involve going to an unvisited receptacle and opening it if necessary.
        
        Note: 
        1. some receptacles have numbers in their names. Always keep them as they are. For example, "towelholder1" should not be changed to "towelholder".
        2. Your initial goal should always be to go to a new location instead of put something into somewhere.
        3. Do not enter stage 2 when not finishing stage 1.

        Note: Always include :negative-preconditions in your :requirements whenever you use (not …) or delete effects, and never leave an :precondition or :effect block empty—either omit it or include at least one literal.

Do not create or assume any objects, relationships, or details that have not been observed, and ensure you include all observations.

        The environment is a room containing various objects. Some of these objects are on, in, or contained within other objects and receptacles. You will initially be located as init_receptacle. You can assume all receptacles are freely reachable.
        
        Now, Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.
        Here are your current observations: Action: go to drawer 1
Nothing happens.


        Only the following actions are allowed: (There are only two types: object and receptacle)
        1. go to a receptacle
            :action GotoLocation
            :parameters (?from - receptacle ?to - receptacle)
        2. open a receptacle if it is closed
            :action OpenObject

            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        4. take an object from another receptacle
            :action PickupObject

        5. put object into/on/in another receptacle
            :action PutObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        6. using an object/receptacle by turning it on/off with a switch
            :action useObject
            :parameters (?o - object)
        7. heat an object using a receptacle
            :action HeatObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - microwaveReceptacle)
        8. clean an object using a receptacle
            :action CleanObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - sinkbasinReceptacle)
        9. cool an object using a receptacle
            :action CoolObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - fridgeReceptacle)
        10. slice an object using a sharp object
            :action SliceObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle ?co - object ?sharp_o - sharpObject)

        You must go to a receptacle first in order to use/open it or take/put objects from/on it.

        The process involves two main stages:

        1. Always searching for the aim Object first!!!
            In this stage, your goal is to go to and may need to open new, unvisited recepatacles until you find the object mentioned in the task. Some receptacles cannot be opened so you can directly see what objects after you go to that receptacle.

            You can only use the GotoLocation action to travel to a new location and the OpenObject action (if the receptacle is closed) to verify whether it contains the target object.

            Goal 1.1: Reach a location that has not been visited (the location should be a receptacle) using the GotoLocation action. 
                You goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (at ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be somewhere or some recepatacles not visited.

            Goal 1.2: If you already go to the recepatacle and found the recepatacle is closed, use the OpenObject action to open it and inspect the contents. 
                Your goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (opened ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be the recepatacle you want to open.

        2. After you seeing the aim object in any receptacle, using the Object to Complete the Task:
            After you have located the object (the object may have some numbers added), you should always first pick up the object from that receptacle and update your goal to focus on how the object is used to complete the task. Remember your goal is Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.. Based on different adjectives, you may need to perform different actions for the object in different ways.

            This may involve more than simply transferring it from one place to another.
            For example: You might examine the object or a nearby receptacle to gather information. You may need to use another tool or device (like a lamp or a switch). Some tasks require you to slice, heat, cool, or clean the object using an appropriate receptacle (e.g., microwave, sink, fridge).

            If necessary, use the PickupObject action to retrieve the item, and the GotoLocation action to move to the correct place.
            Then, apply the object in a purposeful way — not just move it — but interact with the environment to fulfill the task’s actual goal.

            Hint: 
            1. If you want to heat, clean, and cool an object, after you go to that aim receptacle, do not put the object in the receptacle but do the action directly. For example, go to fridge, then cool the object with receptacle.
            2. If you want to slice an object, you should first go to the receptacle where both the sharp object and the aim object are located and ONLY pick up the sharp object then do the slice action. Don't forget to put the sharp object back to the receptacle after you finish slicing.
            3. If you want to examine or look at an object with a lamp, you should first go to the receptacle where the object is located and then pick it up and take the USE action of the lamp. You don't need to take the lamp but directly use it.
            4. If there are multiple actions needed to complete the task, you can break them down into smaller subgoals. For example, if you need to slice and then heat an object, first focus on slicing it, and then move on to heating it.

        In summary, the first stage is all about finding the object—this might involve going to an unvisited receptacle and opening it if necessary.
        
        Note: 
        1. some receptacles have numbers in their names. Always keep them as they are. For example, "towelholder1" should not be changed to "towelholder".
        2. Your initial goal should always be to go to a new location instead of put something into somewhere.
        3. Do not enter stage 2 when not finishing stage 1.

        Note: Always include :negative-preconditions in your :requirements whenever you use (not …) or delete effects, and never leave an :precondition or :effect block empty—either omit it or include at least one literal.

        In summary, the first stage is all about finding the object—this might involve going to an unvisited receptacle and opening it if necessary.
        
        Note: 
        1. some receptacles have numbers in their names. Always keep them as they are. For example, "towelholder1" should not be changed to "towelholder".
        2. Your initial goal should always be to go to a new location instead of put something into somewhere.
        3. Do not enter stage 2 when not finishing stage 1.

        Note: Always include :negative-preconditions in your :requirements whenever you use (not …) or delete effects, and never leave an :precondition or :effect block empty—either omit it or include at least one literal.

Do not create or assume any objects, relationships, or details that have not been observed, and ensure you include all observations.

        The environment is a room containing various objects. Some of these objects are on, in, or contained within other objects and receptacles. You will initially be located as init_receptacle. You can assume all receptacles are freely reachable.
        
        Now, Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.
        Here are your current observations: Action: go to drawer 2
Nothing happens.


        Only the following actions are allowed: (There are only two types: object and receptacle)
        1. go to a receptacle
            :action GotoLocation
            :parameters (?from - receptacle ?to - receptacle)
        2. open a receptacle if it is closed

        3. close a receptacle
            :action CloseObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        4. take an object from another receptacle
            :action PickupObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        5. put object into/on/in another receptacle
            :action PutObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        6. using an object/receptacle by turning it on/off with a switch
            :action useObject
            :parameters (?o - object)
        7. heat an object using a receptacle
            :action HeatObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - microwaveReceptacle)
        8. clean an object using a receptacle
            :action CleanObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - sinkbasinReceptacle)
        9. cool an object using a receptacle
            :action CoolObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - fridgeReceptacle)
        10. slice an object using a sharp object
            :action SliceObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle ?co - object ?sharp_o - sharpObject)

        You must go to a receptacle first in order to use/open it or take/put objects from/on it.

        The process involves two main stages:

        1. Always searching for the aim Object first!!!
            In this stage, your goal is to go to and may need to open new, unvisited recepatacles until you find the object mentioned in the task. Some receptacles cannot be opened so you can directly see what objects after you go to that receptacle.

            You can only use the GotoLocation action to travel to a new location and the OpenObject action (if the receptacle is closed) to verify whether it contains the target object.

            Goal 1.1: Reach a location that has not been visited (the location should be a receptacle) using the GotoLocation action. 
                You goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (at ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be somewhere or some recepatacles not visited.

            Goal 1.2: If you already go to the recepatacle and found the recepatacle is closed, use the OpenObject action to open it and inspect the contents. 
                Your goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (opened ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be the recepatacle you want to open.

        2. After you seeing the aim object in any receptacle, using the Object to Complete the Task:
            After you have located the object (the object may have some numbers added), you should always first pick up the object from that receptacle and update your goal to focus on how the object is used to complete the task. Remember your goal is Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.. Based on different adjectives, you may need to perform different actions for the object in different ways.

            This may involve more than simply transferring it from one place to another.
            For example: You might examine the object or a nearby receptacle to gather information. You may need to use another tool or device (like a lamp or a switch). Some tasks require you to slice, heat, cool, or clean the object using an appropriate receptacle (e.g., microwave, sink, fridge).

            If necessary, use the PickupObject action to retrieve the item, and the GotoLocation action to move to the correct place.
            Then, apply the object in a purposeful way — not just move it — but interact with the environment to fulfill the task’s actual goal.

            Hint: 
            1. If you want to heat, clean, and cool an object, after you go to that aim receptacle, do not put the object in the receptacle but do the action directly. For example, go to fridge, then cool the object with receptacle.
            2. If you want to slice an object, you should first go to the receptacle where both the sharp object and the aim object are located and ONLY pick up the sharp object then do the slice action. Don't forget to put the sharp object back to the receptacle after you finish slicing.
            3. If you want to examine or look at an object with a lamp, you should first go to the receptacle where the object is located and then pick it up and take the USE action of the lamp. You don't need to take the lamp but directly use it.
            4. If there are multiple actions needed to complete the task, you can break them down into smaller subgoals. For example, if you need to slice and then heat an object, first focus on slicing it, and then move on to heating it.

        In summary, the first stage is all about finding the object—this might involve going to an unvisited receptacle and opening it if necessary.
        
        Note: 
        1. some receptacles have numbers in their names. Always keep them as they are. For example, "towelholder1" should not be changed to "towelholder".
        2. Your initial goal should always be to go to a new location instead of put something into somewhere.
        3. Do not enter stage 2 when not finishing stage 1.

        Note: Always include :negative-preconditions in your :requirements whenever you use (not …) or delete effects, and never leave an :precondition or :effect block empty—either omit it or include at least one literal.

                                    Action: go to drawer 2
Nothing happens.
This is the action you take and got something wrong: go to drawer 2. You are trying to go to a receptacle but nothing happens. 
                                        You may already been at this receptacle, in other words, you have already went to this place and do not need to go to this receptacle again.
                                        Otherwise, there is no the receptacle you are aiming to.. Please review both files and fix them.
        Now modify those two files according to the error message.

You arrive at towelholder 1. On the towelholder 1, you see a towel 1.


        Only the following actions are allowed: (There are only two types: object and receptacle)

            :parameters (?o - object)
        7. heat an object using a receptacle
            :action HeatObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - microwaveReceptacle)
        8. clean an object using a receptacle
            :action CleanObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - sinkbasinReceptacle)
        9. cool an object using a receptacle
            :action CoolObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - fridgeReceptacle)
        10. slice an object using a sharp object
            :action SliceObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle ?co - object ?sharp_o - sharpObject)

        You must go to a receptacle first in order to use/open it or take/put objects from/on it.

        The process involves two main stages:

        1. Always searching for the aim Object first!!!
            In this stage, your goal is to go to and may need to open new, unvisited recepatacles until you find the object mentioned in the task. Some receptacles cannot be opened so you can directly see what objects after you go to that receptacle.

            You can only use the GotoLocation action to travel to a new location and the OpenObject action (if the receptacle is closed) to verify whether it contains the target object.

            Goal 1.1: Reach a location that has not been visited (the location should be a receptacle) using the GotoLocation action. 
                You goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (at ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be somewhere or some recepatacles not visited.

            Goal 1.2: If you already go to the recepatacle and found the recepatacle is closed, use the OpenObject action to open it and inspect the contents. 
                Your goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (opened ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be the recepatacle you want to open.

        2. After you seeing the aim object in any receptacle, using the Object to Complete the Task:
            After you have located the object (the object may have some numbers added), you should always first pick up the object from that receptacle and update your goal to focus on how the object is used to complete the task. Remember your goal is Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.. Based on different adjectives, you may need to perform different actions for the object in different ways.

            This may involve more than simply transferring it from one place to another.
            For example: You might examine the object or a nearby receptacle to gather information. You may need to use another tool or device (like a lamp or a switch). Some tasks require you to slice, heat, cool, or clean the object using an appropriate receptacle (e.g., microwave, sink, fridge).

            If necessary, use the PickupObject action to retrieve the item, and the GotoLocation action to move to the correct place.
            Then, apply the object in a purposeful way — not just move it — but interact with the environment to fulfill the task’s actual goal.

            Hint: 
            1. If you want to heat, clean, and cool an object, after you go to that aim receptacle, do not put the object in the receptacle but do the action directly. For example, go to fridge, then cool the object with receptacle.
            2. If you want to slice an object, you should first go to the receptacle where both the sharp object and the aim object are located and ONLY pick up the sharp object then do the slice action. Don't forget to put the sharp object back to the receptacle after you finish slicing.
            3. If you want to examine or look at an object with a lamp, you should first go to the receptacle where the object is located and then pick it up and take the USE action of the lamp. You don't need to take the lamp but directly use it.
            4. If there are multiple actions needed to complete the task, you can break them down into smaller subgoals. For example, if you need to slice and then heat an object, first focus on slicing it, and then move on to heating it.

        In summary, the first stage is all about finding the object—this might involve going to an unvisited receptacle and opening it if necessary.
        
        Note: 
        1. some receptacles have numbers in their names. Always keep them as they are. For example, "towelholder1" should not be changed to "towelholder".
        2. Your initial goal should always be to go to a new location instead of put something into somewhere.
        3. Do not enter stage 2 when not finishing stage 1.

        Note: Always include :negative-preconditions in your :requirements whenever you use (not …) or delete effects, and never leave an :precondition or :effect block empty—either omit it or include at least one literal.

        6. using an object/receptacle by turning it on/off with a switch

            :parameters (?r - receptacle ?co - object ?sharp_o - sharpObject)

        You must go to a receptacle first in order to use/open it or take/put objects from/on it.

        The process involves two main stages:

        1. Always searching for the aim Object first!!!
            In this stage, your goal is to go to and may need to open new, unvisited recepatacles until you find the object mentioned in the task. Some receptacles cannot be opened so you can directly see what objects after you go to that receptacle.

            You can only use the GotoLocation action to travel to a new location and the OpenObject action (if the receptacle is closed) to verify whether it contains the target object.

            Goal 1.1: Reach a location that has not been visited (the location should be a receptacle) using the GotoLocation action. 
                You goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (at ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be somewhere or some recepatacles not visited.

            Goal 1.2: If you already go to the recepatacle and found the recepatacle is closed, use the OpenObject action to open it and inspect the contents. 
                Your goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (opened ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be the recepatacle you want to open.

        2. After you seeing the aim object in any receptacle, using the Object to Complete the Task:
            After you have located the object (the object may have some numbers added), you should always first pick up the object from that receptacle and update your goal to focus on how the object is used to complete the task. Remember your goal is Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.. Based on different adjectives, you may need to perform different actions for the object in different ways.

            This may involve more than simply transferring it from one place to another.
            For example: You might examine the object or a nearby receptacle to gather information. You may need to use another tool or device (like a lamp or a switch). Some tasks require you to slice, heat, cool, or clean the object using an appropriate receptacle (e.g., microwave, sink, fridge).

            If necessary, use the PickupObject action to retrieve the item, and the GotoLocation action to move to the correct place.
            Then, apply the object in a purposeful way — not just move it — but interact with the environment to fulfill the task’s actual goal.

            Hint: 
            1. If you want to heat, clean, and cool an object, after you go to that aim receptacle, do not put the object in the receptacle but do the action directly. For example, go to fridge, then cool the object with receptacle.
            2. If you want to slice an object, you should first go to the receptacle where both the sharp object and the aim object are located and ONLY pick up the sharp object then do the slice action. Don't forget to put the sharp object back to the receptacle after you finish slicing.
            3. If you want to examine or look at an object with a lamp, you should first go to the receptacle where the object is located and then pick it up and take the USE action of the lamp. You don't need to take the lamp but directly use it.
            4. If there are multiple actions needed to complete the task, you can break them down into smaller subgoals. For example, if you need to slice and then heat an object, first focus on slicing it, and then move on to heating it.

        In summary, the first stage is all about finding the object—this might involve going to an unvisited receptacle and opening it if necessary.
        
        Note: 
        1. some receptacles have numbers in their names. Always keep them as they are. For example, "towelholder1" should not be changed to "towelholder".
        2. Your initial goal should always be to go to a new location instead of put something into somewhere.
        3. Do not enter stage 2 when not finishing stage 1.

        Note: Always include :negative-preconditions in your :requirements whenever you use (not …) or delete effects, and never leave an :precondition or :effect block empty—either omit it or include at least one literal.

        You are in an environment that you must explore step by step. Your task is to build and update PDDL files for the environment using only your direct observations. Do not create or assume any objects, relationships, or details that have not been observed, and ensure you include all observations.

        The environment is a room containing various objects. Some of these objects are on, in, or contained within other objects and receptacles. You will initially be located as init_receptacle. You can assume all receptacles are freely reachable.
        
        Now, Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.
        Here are your current observations: Action: go to dresser 1
Nothing happens.


        Only the following actions are allowed: (There are only two types: object and receptacle)
        1. go to a receptacle
            :action GotoLocation
            :parameters (?from - receptacle ?to - receptacle)
        2. open a receptacle if it is closed
            :action OpenObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        3. close a receptacle
            :action CloseObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        4. take an object from another receptacle
            :action PickupObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        5. put object into/on/in another receptacle
            :action PutObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        6. using an object/receptacle by turning it on/off with a switch
            :action useObject
            :parameters (?o - object)
        7. heat an object using a receptacle
            :action HeatObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - microwaveReceptacle)
        8. clean an object using a receptacle
            :action CleanObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - sinkbasinReceptacle)
        9. cool an object using a receptacle
            :action CoolObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - fridgeReceptacle)
        10. slice an object using a sharp object
            :action SliceObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle ?co - object ?sharp_o - sharpObject)

        You must go to a receptacle first in order to use/open it or take/put objects from/on it.

        The process involves two main stages:

        1. Always searching for the aim Object first!!!
            In this stage, your goal is to go to and may need to open new, unvisited recepatacles until you find the object mentioned in the task. Some receptacles cannot be opened so you can directly see what objects after you go to that receptacle.

            You can only use the GotoLocation action to travel to a new location and the OpenObject action (if the receptacle is closed) to verify whether it contains the target object.

            Goal 1.1: Reach a location that has not been visited (the location should be a receptacle) using the GotoLocation action. 
                You goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (at ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be somewhere or some recepatacles not visited.

            Goal 1.2: If you already go to the recepatacle and found the recepatacle is closed, use the OpenObject action to open it and inspect the contents. 
                Your goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (opened ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be the recepatacle you want to open.

        2. After you seeing the aim object in any receptacle, using the Object to Complete the Task:
            After you have located the object (the object may have some numbers added), you should always first pick up the object from that receptacle and update your goal to focus on how the object is used to complete the task. Remember your goal is Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.. Based on different adjectives, you may need to perform different actions for the object in different ways.

            This may involve more than simply transferring it from one place to another.
            For example: You might examine the object or a nearby receptacle to gather information. You may need to use another tool or device (like a lamp or a switch). Some tasks require you to slice, heat, cool, or clean the object using an appropriate receptacle (e.g., microwave, sink, fridge).

            If necessary, use the PickupObject action to retrieve the item, and the GotoLocation action to move to the correct place.
            Then, apply the object in a purposeful way — not just move it — but interact with the environment to fulfill the task’s actual goal.

            Hint: 
            1. If you want to heat, clean, and cool an object, after you go to that aim receptacle, do not put the object in the receptacle but do the action directly. For example, go to fridge, then cool the object with receptacle.
            2. If you want to slice an object, you should first go to the receptacle where both the sharp object and the aim object are located and ONLY pick up the sharp object then do the slice action. Don't forget to put the sharp object back to the receptacle after you finish slicing.
            3. If you want to examine or look at an object with a lamp, you should first go to the receptacle where the object is located and then pick it up and take the USE action of the lamp. You don't need to take the lamp but directly use it.
            4. If there are multiple actions needed to complete the task, you can break them down into smaller subgoals. For example, if you need to slice and then heat an object, first focus on slicing it, and then move on to heating it.

        In summary, the first stage is all about finding the object—this might involve going to an unvisited receptacle and opening it if necessary.
        
        Note: 
        1. some receptacles have numbers in their names. Always keep them as they are. For example, "towelholder1" should not be changed to "towelholder".
        2. Your initial goal should always be to go to a new location instead of put something into somewhere.
        3. Do not enter stage 2 when not finishing stage 1.

        Note: Always include :negative-preconditions in your :requirements whenever you use (not …) or delete effects, and never leave an :precondition or :effect block empty—either omit it or include at least one literal.

Do not create or assume any objects, relationships, or details that have not been observed, and ensure you include all observations.

        The environment is a room containing various objects. Some of these objects are on, in, or contained within other objects and receptacles. You will initially be located as init_receptacle. You can assume all receptacles are freely reachable.
        
        Now, Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.
        Here are your current observations: Action: go to handtowelholder 1
You arrive at handtowelholder 1. On the handtowelholder 1, you see a handtowel 1.


        Only the following actions are allowed: (There are only two types: object and receptacle)
        1. go to a receptacle
            :action GotoLocation
            :parameters (?from - receptacle ?to - receptacle)
        2. open a receptacle if it is closed

        5. put object into/on/in another receptacle

            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        6. using an object/receptacle by turning it on/off with a switch
            :action useObject
            :parameters (?o - object)
        7. heat an object using a receptacle
            :action HeatObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - microwaveReceptacle)
        8. clean an object using a receptacle
            :action CleanObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - sinkbasinReceptacle)
        9. cool an object using a receptacle
            :action CoolObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - fridgeReceptacle)
        10. slice an object using a sharp object
            :action SliceObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle ?co - object ?sharp_o - sharpObject)

        You must go to a receptacle first in order to use/open it or take/put objects from/on it.

        The process involves two main stages:

        1. Always searching for the aim Object first!!!
            In this stage, your goal is to go to and may need to open new, unvisited recepatacles until you find the object mentioned in the task. Some receptacles cannot be opened so you can directly see what objects after you go to that receptacle.

            You can only use the GotoLocation action to travel to a new location and the OpenObject action (if the receptacle is closed) to verify whether it contains the target object.

            Goal 1.1: Reach a location that has not been visited (the location should be a receptacle) using the GotoLocation action. 
                You goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (at ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be somewhere or some recepatacles not visited.

            Goal 1.2: If you already go to the recepatacle and found the recepatacle is closed, use the OpenObject action to open it and inspect the contents. 
                Your goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (opened ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be the recepatacle you want to open.

        2. After you seeing the aim object in any receptacle, using the Object to Complete the Task:
            After you have located the object (the object may have some numbers added), you should always first pick up the object from that receptacle and update your goal to focus on how the object is used to complete the task. Remember your goal is Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.. Based on different adjectives, you may need to perform different actions for the object in different ways.

            This may involve more than simply transferring it from one place to another.
            For example: You might examine the object or a nearby receptacle to gather information. You may need to use another tool or device (like a lamp or a switch). Some tasks require you to slice, heat, cool, or clean the object using an appropriate receptacle (e.g., microwave, sink, fridge).

            If necessary, use the PickupObject action to retrieve the item, and the GotoLocation action to move to the correct place.
            Then, apply the object in a purposeful way — not just move it — but interact with the environment to fulfill the task’s actual goal.

            Hint: 
            1. If you want to heat, clean, and cool an object, after you go to that aim receptacle, do not put the object in the receptacle but do the action directly. For example, go to fridge, then cool the object with receptacle.
            2. If you want to slice an object, you should first go to the receptacle where both the sharp object and the aim object are located and ONLY pick up the sharp object then do the slice action. Don't forget to put the sharp object back to the receptacle after you finish slicing.
            3. If you want to examine or look at an object with a lamp, you should first go to the receptacle where the object is located and then pick it up and take the USE action of the lamp. You don't need to take the lamp but directly use it.
            4. If there are multiple actions needed to complete the task, you can break them down into smaller subgoals. For example, if you need to slice and then heat an object, first focus on slicing it, and then move on to heating it.

        In summary, the first stage is all about finding the object—this might involve going to an unvisited receptacle and opening it if necessary.
        
        Note: 
        1. some receptacles have numbers in their names. Always keep them as they are. For example, "towelholder1" should not be changed to "towelholder".
        2. Your initial goal should always be to go to a new location instead of put something into somewhere.
        3. Do not enter stage 2 when not finishing stage 1.

        Note: Always include :negative-preconditions in your :requirements whenever you use (not …) or delete effects, and never leave an :precondition or :effect block empty—either omit it or include at least one literal.

                Your goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (opened ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be the recepatacle you want to open.

        2. After you seeing the aim object in any receptacle, using the Object to Complete the Task:
            After you have located the object (the object may have some numbers added), you should always first pick up the object from that receptacle and update your goal to focus on how the object is used to complete the task. Remember your goal is Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.. Based on different adjectives, you may need to perform different actions for the object in different ways.

            This may involve more than simply transferring it from one place to another.
            For example: You might examine the object or a nearby receptacle to gather information. You may need to use another tool or device (like a lamp or a switch). Some tasks require you to slice, heat, cool, or clean the object using an appropriate receptacle (e.g., microwave, sink, fridge).

            If necessary, use the PickupObject action to retrieve the item, and the GotoLocation action to move to the correct place.
            Then, apply the object in a purposeful way — not just move it — but interact with the environment to fulfill the task’s actual goal.

            Hint: 
            1. If you want to heat, clean, and cool an object, after you go to that aim receptacle, do not put the object in the receptacle but do the action directly. For example, go to fridge, then cool the object with receptacle.
            2. If you want to slice an object, you should first go to the receptacle where both the sharp object and the aim object are located and ONLY pick up the sharp object then do the slice action. Don't forget to put the sharp object back to the receptacle after you finish slicing.
            3. If you want to examine or look at an object with a lamp, you should first go to the receptacle where the object is located and then pick it up and take the USE action of the lamp. You don't need to take the lamp but directly use it.
            4. If there are multiple actions needed to complete the task, you can break them down into smaller subgoals. For example, if you need to slice and then heat an object, first focus on slicing it, and then move on to heating it.

        In summary, the first stage is all about finding the object—this might involve going to an unvisited receptacle and opening it if necessary.
        
        Note: 
        1. some receptacles have numbers in their names. Always keep them as they are. For example, "towelholder1" should not be changed to "towelholder".
        2. Your initial goal should always be to go to a new location instead of put something into somewhere.
        3. Do not enter stage 2 when not finishing stage 1.

        Note: Always include :negative-preconditions in your :requirements whenever you use (not …) or delete effects, and never leave an :precondition or :effect block empty—either omit it or include at least one literal.

        You are in an environment that you must explore step by step. Your task is to build and update PDDL files for the environment using only your direct observations. Do not create or assume any objects, relationships, or details that have not been observed, and ensure you include all observations.

        The environment is a room containing various objects. Some of these objects are on, in, or contained within other objects and receptacles. You will initially be located as init_receptacle. You can assume all receptacles are freely reachable.
        
        Now, Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.
        Here are your current observations: Action: go to sinkbasin 2
You arrive at sinkbasin 2. On the sinkbasin 2, you see nothing.


        Only the following actions are allowed: (There are only two types: object and receptacle)
        1. go to a receptacle
            :action GotoLocation
            :parameters (?from - receptacle ?to - receptacle)
        2. open a receptacle if it is closed
            :action OpenObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        3. close a receptacle
            :action CloseObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        4. take an object from another receptacle
            :action PickupObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        5. put object into/on/in another receptacle
            :action PutObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        6. using an object/receptacle by turning it on/off with a switch
            :action useObject
            :parameters (?o - object)
        7. heat an object using a receptacle
            :action HeatObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - microwaveReceptacle)
        8. clean an object using a receptacle
            :action CleanObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - sinkbasinReceptacle)
        9. cool an object using a receptacle
            :action CoolObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - fridgeReceptacle)
        10. slice an object using a sharp object
            :action SliceObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle ?co - object ?sharp_o - sharpObject)

        You must go to a receptacle first in order to use/open it or take/put objects from/on it.

        The process involves two main stages:

        1. Always searching for the aim Object first!!!
            In this stage, your goal is to go to and may need to open new, unvisited recepatacles until you find the object mentioned in the task. Some receptacles cannot be opened so you can directly see what objects after you go to that receptacle.

            You can only use the GotoLocation action to travel to a new location and the OpenObject action (if the receptacle is closed) to verify whether it contains the target object.

            Goal 1.1: Reach a location that has not been visited (the location should be a receptacle) using the GotoLocation action. 
                You goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (at ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be somewhere or some recepatacles not visited.

            Goal 1.2: If you already go to the recepatacle and found the recepatacle is closed, use the OpenObject action to open it and inspect the contents. 
                Your goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (opened ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be the recepatacle you want to open.

        2. After you seeing the aim object in any receptacle, using the Object to Complete the Task:
            After you have located the object (the object may have some numbers added), you should always first pick up the object from that receptacle and update your goal to focus on how the object is used to complete the task. Remember your goal is Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.. Based on different adjectives, you may need to perform different actions for the object in different ways.

            This may involve more than simply transferring it from one place to another.
            For example: You might examine the object or a nearby receptacle to gather information. You may need to use another tool or device (like a lamp or a switch). Some tasks require you to slice, heat, cool, or clean the object using an appropriate receptacle (e.g., microwave, sink, fridge).

            If necessary, use the PickupObject action to retrieve the item, and the GotoLocation action to move to the correct place.
            Then, apply the object in a purposeful way — not just move it — but interact with the environment to fulfill the task’s actual goal.

            Hint: 
            1. If you want to heat, clean, and cool an object, after you go to that aim receptacle, do not put the object in the receptacle but do the action directly. For example, go to fridge, then cool the object with receptacle.
            2. If you want to slice an object, you should first go to the receptacle where both the sharp object and the aim object are located and ONLY pick up the sharp object then do the slice action. Don't forget to put the sharp object back to the receptacle after you finish slicing.
            3. If you want to examine or look at an object with a lamp, you should first go to the receptacle where the object is located and then pick it up and take the USE action of the lamp. You don't need to take the lamp but directly use it.
            4. If there are multiple actions needed to complete the task, you can break them down into smaller subgoals. For example, if you need to slice and then heat an object, first focus on slicing it, and then move on to heating it.

        In summary, the first stage is all about finding the object—this might involve going to an unvisited receptacle and opening it if necessary.
        
        Note: 
        1. some receptacles have numbers in their names. Always keep them as they are. For example, "towelholder1" should not be changed to "towelholder".
        2. Your initial goal should always be to go to a new location instead of put something into somewhere.
        3. Do not enter stage 2 when not finishing stage 1.

        Note: Always include :negative-preconditions in your :requirements whenever you use (not …) or delete effects, and never leave an :precondition or :effect block empty—either omit it or include at least one literal.

        You are in an environment that you must explore step by step. Your task is to build and update PDDL files for the environment using only your direct observations. Do not create or assume any objects, relationships, or details that have not been observed, and ensure you include all observations.

        The environment is a room containing various objects. Some of these objects are on, in, or contained within other objects and receptacles. You will initially be located as init_receptacle. You can assume all receptacles are freely reachable.
        
        Now, Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.
        Here are your current observations: Action: go to toilet 1
You arrive at toilet 1. On the toilet 1, you see nothing.


        Only the following actions are allowed: (There are only two types: object and receptacle)
        1. go to a receptacle
            :action GotoLocation
            :parameters (?from - receptacle ?to - receptacle)
        2. open a receptacle if it is closed
            :action OpenObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        3. close a receptacle
            :action CloseObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        4. take an object from another receptacle
            :action PickupObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        5. put object into/on/in another receptacle
            :action PutObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        6. using an object/receptacle by turning it on/off with a switch
            :action useObject
            :parameters (?o - object)
        7. heat an object using a receptacle
            :action HeatObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - microwaveReceptacle)
        8. clean an object using a receptacle
            :action CleanObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - sinkbasinReceptacle)
        9. cool an object using a receptacle
            :action CoolObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - fridgeReceptacle)
        10. slice an object using a sharp object
            :action SliceObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle ?co - object ?sharp_o - sharpObject)

        You must go to a receptacle first in order to use/open it or take/put objects from/on it.

        The process involves two main stages:

        1. Always searching for the aim Object first!!!
            In this stage, your goal is to go to and may need to open new, unvisited recepatacles until you find the object mentioned in the task. Some receptacles cannot be opened so you can directly see what objects after you go to that receptacle.

            You can only use the GotoLocation action to travel to a new location and the OpenObject action (if the receptacle is closed) to verify whether it contains the target object.

            Goal 1.1: Reach a location that has not been visited (the location should be a receptacle) using the GotoLocation action. 
                You goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (at ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be somewhere or some recepatacles not visited.

            Goal 1.2: If you already go to the recepatacle and found the recepatacle is closed, use the OpenObject action to open it and inspect the contents. 
                Your goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (opened ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be the recepatacle you want to open.

        2. After you seeing the aim object in any receptacle, using the Object to Complete the Task:
            After you have located the object (the object may have some numbers added), you should always first pick up the object from that receptacle and update your goal to focus on how the object is used to complete the task. Remember your goal is Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.. Based on different adjectives, you may need to perform different actions for the object in different ways.

            This may involve more than simply transferring it from one place to another.
            For example: You might examine the object or a nearby receptacle to gather information. You may need to use another tool or device (like a lamp or a switch). Some tasks require you to slice, heat, cool, or clean the object using an appropriate receptacle (e.g., microwave, sink, fridge).

            If necessary, use the PickupObject action to retrieve the item, and the GotoLocation action to move to the correct place.
            Then, apply the object in a purposeful way — not just move it — but interact with the environment to fulfill the task’s actual goal.

            Hint: 
            1. If you want to heat, clean, and cool an object, after you go to that aim receptacle, do not put the object in the receptacle but do the action directly. For example, go to fridge, then cool the object with receptacle.
            2. If you want to slice an object, you should first go to the receptacle where both the sharp object and the aim object are located and ONLY pick up the sharp object then do the slice action. Don't forget to put the sharp object back to the receptacle after you finish slicing.
            3. If you want to examine or look at an object with a lamp, you should first go to the receptacle where the object is located and then pick it up and take the USE action of the lamp. You don't need to take the lamp but directly use it.
            4. If there are multiple actions needed to complete the task, you can break them down into smaller subgoals. For example, if you need to slice and then heat an object, first focus on slicing it, and then move on to heating it.

        In summary, the first stage is all about finding the object—this might involve going to an unvisited receptacle and opening it if necessary.
        
        Note: 
        1. some receptacles have numbers in their names. Always keep them as they are. For example, "towelholder1" should not be changed to "towelholder".
        2. Your initial goal should always be to go to a new location instead of put something into somewhere.
        3. Do not enter stage 2 when not finishing stage 1.

        Note: Always include :negative-preconditions in your :requirements whenever you use (not …) or delete effects, and never leave an :precondition or :effect block empty—either omit it or include at least one literal.

        You are in an environment that you must explore step by step. Your task is to build and update PDDL files for the environment using only your direct observations. Do not create or assume any objects, relationships, or details that have not been observed, and ensure you include all observations.

        The environment is a room containing various objects. Some of these objects are on, in, or contained within other objects and receptacles. You will initially be located as init_receptacle. You can assume all receptacles are freely reachable.
        
        Now, Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.
        Here are your current observations: Action: go to bathtubbasin 1
You arrive at bathtubbasin 1. On the bathtubbasin 1, you see a cloth 1, a soapbar 2, and a soapbar 1.


        Only the following actions are allowed: (There are only two types: object and receptacle)
        1. go to a receptacle
            :action GotoLocation
            :parameters (?from - receptacle ?to - receptacle)
        2. open a receptacle if it is closed

        3. close a receptacle
            :action CloseObject

        4. take an object from another receptacle
            :action PickupObject

        5. put object into/on/in another receptacle
            :action PutObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        6. using an object/receptacle by turning it on/off with a switch
            :action useObject
            :parameters (?o - object)
        7. heat an object using a receptacle
            :action HeatObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - microwaveReceptacle)
        8. clean an object using a receptacle
            :action CleanObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - sinkbasinReceptacle)
        9. cool an object using a receptacle
            :action CoolObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - fridgeReceptacle)
        10. slice an object using a sharp object
            :action SliceObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle ?co - object ?sharp_o - sharpObject)

        You must go to a receptacle first in order to use/open it or take/put objects from/on it.

        The process involves two main stages:

        1. Always searching for the aim Object first!!!
            In this stage, your goal is to go to and may need to open new, unvisited recepatacles until you find the object mentioned in the task. Some receptacles cannot be opened so you can directly see what objects after you go to that receptacle.

            You can only use the GotoLocation action to travel to a new location and the OpenObject action (if the receptacle is closed) to verify whether it contains the target object.

            Goal 1.1: Reach a location that has not been visited (the location should be a receptacle) using the GotoLocation action. 
                You goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (at ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be somewhere or some recepatacles not visited.

            Goal 1.2: If you already go to the recepatacle and found the recepatacle is closed, use the OpenObject action to open it and inspect the contents. 
                Your goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (opened ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be the recepatacle you want to open.

        2. After you seeing the aim object in any receptacle, using the Object to Complete the Task:
            After you have located the object (the object may have some numbers added), you should always first pick up the object from that receptacle and update your goal to focus on how the object is used to complete the task. Remember your goal is Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.. Based on different adjectives, you may need to perform different actions for the object in different ways.

            This may involve more than simply transferring it from one place to another.
            For example: You might examine the object or a nearby receptacle to gather information. You may need to use another tool or device (like a lamp or a switch). Some tasks require you to slice, heat, cool, or clean the object using an appropriate receptacle (e.g., microwave, sink, fridge).

            If necessary, use the PickupObject action to retrieve the item, and the GotoLocation action to move to the correct place.
            Then, apply the object in a purposeful way — not just move it — but interact with the environment to fulfill the task’s actual goal.

            Hint: 
            1. If you want to heat, clean, and cool an object, after you go to that aim receptacle, do not put the object in the receptacle but do the action directly. For example, go to fridge, then cool the object with receptacle.
            2. If you want to slice an object, you should first go to the receptacle where both the sharp object and the aim object are located and ONLY pick up the sharp object then do the slice action. Don't forget to put the sharp object back to the receptacle after you finish slicing.
            3. If you want to examine or look at an object with a lamp, you should first go to the receptacle where the object is located and then pick it up and take the USE action of the lamp. You don't need to take the lamp but directly use it.
            4. If there are multiple actions needed to complete the task, you can break them down into smaller subgoals. For example, if you need to slice and then heat an object, first focus on slicing it, and then move on to heating it.

        In summary, the first stage is all about finding the object—this might involve going to an unvisited receptacle and opening it if necessary.
        
        Note: 
        1. some receptacles have numbers in their names. Always keep them as they are. For example, "towelholder1" should not be changed to "towelholder".
        2. Your initial goal should always be to go to a new location instead of put something into somewhere.
        3. Do not enter stage 2 when not finishing stage 1.

        Note: Always include :negative-preconditions in your :requirements whenever you use (not …) or delete effects, and never leave an :precondition or :effect block empty—either omit it or include at least one literal.

            If necessary, use the PickupObject action to retrieve the item, and the GotoLocation action to move to the correct place.
            Then, apply the object in a purposeful way — not just move it — but interact with the environment to fulfill the task’s actual goal.

            Hint: 
            1. If you want to heat, clean, and cool an object, after you go to that aim receptacle, do not put the object in the receptacle but do the action directly. For example, go to fridge, then cool the object with receptacle.
            2. If you want to slice an object, you should first go to the receptacle where both the sharp object and the aim object are located and ONLY pick up the sharp object then do the slice action. Don't forget to put the sharp object back to the receptacle after you finish slicing.
            3. If you want to examine or look at an object with a lamp, you should first go to the receptacle where the object is located and then pick it up and take the USE action of the lamp. You don't need to take the lamp but directly use it.
            4. If there are multiple actions needed to complete the task, you can break them down into smaller subgoals. For example, if you need to slice and then heat an object, first focus on slicing it, and then move on to heating it.

        In summary, the first stage is all about finding the object—this might involve going to an unvisited receptacle and opening it if necessary.
        
        Note: 
        1. some receptacles have numbers in their names. Always keep them as they are. For example, "towelholder1" should not be changed to "towelholder".
        2. Your initial goal should always be to go to a new location instead of put something into somewhere.
        3. Do not enter stage 2 when not finishing stage 1.

        Note: Always include :negative-preconditions in your :requirements whenever you use (not …) or delete effects, and never leave an :precondition or :effect block empty—either omit it or include at least one literal.

        You are in an environment that you must explore step by step. Your task is to build and update PDDL files for the environment using only your direct observations. Do not create or assume any objects, relationships, or details that have not been observed, and ensure you include all observations.

        The environment is a room containing various objects. Some of these objects are on, in, or contained within other objects and receptacles. You will initially be located as init_receptacle. You can assume all receptacles are freely reachable.
        
        Now, Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.
        Here are your current observations: Action: go to sinkbasin 2
You arrive at sinkbasin 2. On the sinkbasin 2, you see nothing.


        Only the following actions are allowed: (There are only two types: object and receptacle)
        1. go to a receptacle
            :action GotoLocation
            :parameters (?from - receptacle ?to - receptacle)
        2. open a receptacle if it is closed
            :action OpenObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        3. close a receptacle
            :action CloseObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        4. take an object from another receptacle
            :action PickupObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        5. put object into/on/in another receptacle
            :action PutObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        6. using an object/receptacle by turning it on/off with a switch
            :action useObject
            :parameters (?o - object)
        7. heat an object using a receptacle
            :action HeatObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - microwaveReceptacle)
        8. clean an object using a receptacle
            :action CleanObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - sinkbasinReceptacle)
        9. cool an object using a receptacle
            :action CoolObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - fridgeReceptacle)
        10. slice an object using a sharp object
            :action SliceObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle ?co - object ?sharp_o - sharpObject)

        You must go to a receptacle first in order to use/open it or take/put objects from/on it.

        The process involves two main stages:

        1. Always searching for the aim Object first!!!
            In this stage, your goal is to go to and may need to open new, unvisited recepatacles until you find the object mentioned in the task. Some receptacles cannot be opened so you can directly see what objects after you go to that receptacle.

            You can only use the GotoLocation action to travel to a new location and the OpenObject action (if the receptacle is closed) to verify whether it contains the target object.

            Goal 1.1: Reach a location that has not been visited (the location should be a receptacle) using the GotoLocation action. 
                You goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (at ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be somewhere or some recepatacles not visited.

            Goal 1.2: If you already go to the recepatacle and found the recepatacle is closed, use the OpenObject action to open it and inspect the contents. 
                Your goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (opened ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be the recepatacle you want to open.

        2. After you seeing the aim object in any receptacle, using the Object to Complete the Task:
            After you have located the object (the object may have some numbers added), you should always first pick up the object from that receptacle and update your goal to focus on how the object is used to complete the task. Remember your goal is Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.. Based on different adjectives, you may need to perform different actions for the object in different ways.

            This may involve more than simply transferring it from one place to another.
            For example: You might examine the object or a nearby receptacle to gather information. You may need to use another tool or device (like a lamp or a switch). Some tasks require you to slice, heat, cool, or clean the object using an appropriate receptacle (e.g., microwave, sink, fridge).

            If necessary, use the PickupObject action to retrieve the item, and the GotoLocation action to move to the correct place.
            Then, apply the object in a purposeful way — not just move it — but interact with the environment to fulfill the task’s actual goal.

            Hint: 
            1. If you want to heat, clean, and cool an object, after you go to that aim receptacle, do not put the object in the receptacle but do the action directly. For example, go to fridge, then cool the object with receptacle.
            2. If you want to slice an object, you should first go to the receptacle where both the sharp object and the aim object are located and ONLY pick up the sharp object then do the slice action. Don't forget to put the sharp object back to the receptacle after you finish slicing.
            3. If you want to examine or look at an object with a lamp, you should first go to the receptacle where the object is located and then pick it up and take the USE action of the lamp. You don't need to take the lamp but directly use it.
            4. If there are multiple actions needed to complete the task, you can break them down into smaller subgoals. For example, if you need to slice and then heat an object, first focus on slicing it, and then move on to heating it.

        In summary, the first stage is all about finding the object—this might involve going to an unvisited receptacle and opening it if necessary.
        
        Note: 
        1. some receptacles have numbers in their names. Always keep them as they are. For example, "towelholder1" should not be changed to "towelholder".
        2. Your initial goal should always be to go to a new location instead of put something into somewhere.
        3. Do not enter stage 2 when not finishing stage 1.

        Note: Always include :negative-preconditions in your :requirements whenever you use (not …) or delete effects, and never leave an :precondition or :effect block empty—either omit it or include at least one literal.

        You are in an environment that you must explore step by step. Your task is to build and update PDDL files for the environment using only your direct observations. Do not create or assume any objects, relationships, or details that have not been observed, and ensure you include all observations.

        The environment is a room containing various objects. Some of these objects are on, in, or contained within other objects and receptacles. You will initially be located as init_receptacle. You can assume all receptacles are freely reachable.
        
        Now, Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.
        Here are your current observations: Action: go to toilet 1
You arrive at toilet 1. On the toilet 1, you see nothing.


        Only the following actions are allowed: (There are only two types: object and receptacle)
        1. go to a receptacle
            :action GotoLocation
            :parameters (?from - receptacle ?to - receptacle)
        2. open a receptacle if it is closed
            :action OpenObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        3. close a receptacle
            :action CloseObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        4. take an object from another receptacle
            :action PickupObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        5. put object into/on/in another receptacle
            :action PutObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        6. using an object/receptacle by turning it on/off with a switch
            :action useObject
            :parameters (?o - object)
        7. heat an object using a receptacle
            :action HeatObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - microwaveReceptacle)
        8. clean an object using a receptacle
            :action CleanObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - sinkbasinReceptacle)
        9. cool an object using a receptacle
            :action CoolObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - fridgeReceptacle)
        10. slice an object using a sharp object
            :action SliceObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle ?co - object ?sharp_o - sharpObject)

        You must go to a receptacle first in order to use/open it or take/put objects from/on it.

        The process involves two main stages:

        1. Always searching for the aim Object first!!!
            In this stage, your goal is to go to and may need to open new, unvisited recepatacles until you find the object mentioned in the task. Some receptacles cannot be opened so you can directly see what objects after you go to that receptacle.

            You can only use the GotoLocation action to travel to a new location and the OpenObject action (if the receptacle is closed) to verify whether it contains the target object.

            Goal 1.1: Reach a location that has not been visited (the location should be a receptacle) using the GotoLocation action. 
                You goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (at ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be somewhere or some recepatacles not visited.

            Goal 1.2: If you already go to the recepatacle and found the recepatacle is closed, use the OpenObject action to open it and inspect the contents. 
                Your goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (opened ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be the recepatacle you want to open.

        2. After you seeing the aim object in any receptacle, using the Object to Complete the Task:
            After you have located the object (the object may have some numbers added), you should always first pick up the object from that receptacle and update your goal to focus on how the object is used to complete the task. Remember your goal is Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.. Based on different adjectives, you may need to perform different actions for the object in different ways.

            This may involve more than simply transferring it from one place to another.
            For example: You might examine the object or a nearby receptacle to gather information. You may need to use another tool or device (like a lamp or a switch). Some tasks require you to slice, heat, cool, or clean the object using an appropriate receptacle (e.g., microwave, sink, fridge).

            If necessary, use the PickupObject action to retrieve the item, and the GotoLocation action to move to the correct place.
            Then, apply the object in a purposeful way — not just move it — but interact with the environment to fulfill the task’s actual goal.

            Hint: 
            1. If you want to heat, clean, and cool an object, after you go to that aim receptacle, do not put the object in the receptacle but do the action directly. For example, go to fridge, then cool the object with receptacle.
            2. If you want to slice an object, you should first go to the receptacle where both the sharp object and the aim object are located and ONLY pick up the sharp object then do the slice action. Don't forget to put the sharp object back to the receptacle after you finish slicing.
            3. If you want to examine or look at an object with a lamp, you should first go to the receptacle where the object is located and then pick it up and take the USE action of the lamp. You don't need to take the lamp but directly use it.
            4. If there are multiple actions needed to complete the task, you can break them down into smaller subgoals. For example, if you need to slice and then heat an object, first focus on slicing it, and then move on to heating it.

        In summary, the first stage is all about finding the object—this might involve going to an unvisited receptacle and opening it if necessary.
        
        Note: 
        1. some receptacles have numbers in their names. Always keep them as they are. For example, "towelholder1" should not be changed to "towelholder".
        2. Your initial goal should always be to go to a new location instead of put something into somewhere.
        3. Do not enter stage 2 when not finishing stage 1.

        Note: Always include :negative-preconditions in your :requirements whenever you use (not …) or delete effects, and never leave an :precondition or :effect block empty—either omit it or include at least one literal.

        You are in an environment that you must explore step by step. Your task is to build and update PDDL files for the environment using only your direct observations. Do not create or assume any objects, relationships, or details that have not been observed, and ensure you include all observations.

        The environment is a room containing various objects. Some of these objects are on, in, or contained within other objects and receptacles. You will initially be located as init_receptacle. You can assume all receptacles are freely reachable.
        
        Now, Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.
        Here are your current observations: Action: go to bathtubbasin 1
You arrive at bathtubbasin 1. On the bathtubbasin 1, you see a cloth 1, a soapbar 2, and a soapbar 1.


        Only the following actions are allowed: (There are only two types: object and receptacle)
        1. go to a receptacle
            :action GotoLocation
            :parameters (?from - receptacle ?to - receptacle)
        2. open a receptacle if it is closed
            :action OpenObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        3. close a receptacle
            :action CloseObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        4. take an object from another receptacle
            :action PickupObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        5. put object into/on/in another receptacle
            :action PutObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        6. using an object/receptacle by turning it on/off with a switch
            :action useObject
            :parameters (?o - object)
        7. heat an object using a receptacle
            :action HeatObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - microwaveReceptacle)
        8. clean an object using a receptacle
            :action CleanObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - sinkbasinReceptacle)
        9. cool an object using a receptacle
            :action CoolObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - fridgeReceptacle)
        10. slice an object using a sharp object
            :action SliceObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle ?co - object ?sharp_o - sharpObject)

        You must go to a receptacle first in order to use/open it or take/put objects from/on it.

        The process involves two main stages:

        1. Always searching for the aim Object first!!!
            In this stage, your goal is to go to and may need to open new, unvisited recepatacles until you find the object mentioned in the task. Some receptacles cannot be opened so you can directly see what objects after you go to that receptacle.

            You can only use the GotoLocation action to travel to a new location and the OpenObject action (if the receptacle is closed) to verify whether it contains the target object.

            Goal 1.1: Reach a location that has not been visited (the location should be a receptacle) using the GotoLocation action. 
                You goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (at ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be somewhere or some recepatacles not visited.

            Goal 1.2: If you already go to the recepatacle and found the recepatacle is closed, use the OpenObject action to open it and inspect the contents. 
                Your goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (opened ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be the recepatacle you want to open.

        2. After you seeing the aim object in any receptacle, using the Object to Complete the Task:
            After you have located the object (the object may have some numbers added), you should always first pick up the object from that receptacle and update your goal to focus on how the object is used to complete the task. Remember your goal is Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.. Based on different adjectives, you may need to perform different actions for the object in different ways.

            This may involve more than simply transferring it from one place to another.
            For example: You might examine the object or a nearby receptacle to gather information. You may need to use another tool or device (like a lamp or a switch). Some tasks require you to slice, heat, cool, or clean the object using an appropriate receptacle (e.g., microwave, sink, fridge).

            If necessary, use the PickupObject action to retrieve the item, and the GotoLocation action to move to the correct place.
            Then, apply the object in a purposeful way — not just move it — but interact with the environment to fulfill the task’s actual goal.

            Hint: 
            1. If you want to heat, clean, and cool an object, after you go to that aim receptacle, do not put the object in the receptacle but do the action directly. For example, go to fridge, then cool the object with receptacle.
            2. If you want to slice an object, you should first go to the receptacle where both the sharp object and the aim object are located and ONLY pick up the sharp object then do the slice action. Don't forget to put the sharp object back to the receptacle after you finish slicing.
            3. If you want to examine or look at an object with a lamp, you should first go to the receptacle where the object is located and then pick it up and take the USE action of the lamp. You don't need to take the lamp but directly use it.
            4. If there are multiple actions needed to complete the task, you can break them down into smaller subgoals. For example, if you need to slice and then heat an object, first focus on slicing it, and then move on to heating it.

        In summary, the first stage is all about finding the object—this might involve going to an unvisited receptacle and opening it if necessary.
        
        Note: 
        1. some receptacles have numbers in their names. Always keep them as they are. For example, "towelholder1" should not be changed to "towelholder".
        2. Your initial goal should always be to go to a new location instead of put something into somewhere.
        3. Do not enter stage 2 when not finishing stage 1.

        Note: Always include :negative-preconditions in your :requirements whenever you use (not …) or delete effects, and never leave an :precondition or :effect block empty—either omit it or include at least one literal.

        2. After you seeing the aim object in any receptacle, using the Object to Complete the Task:
            After you have located the object (the object may have some numbers added), you should always first pick up the object from that receptacle and update your goal to focus on how the object is used to complete the task. Remember your goal is Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.. Based on different adjectives, you may need to perform different actions for the object in different ways.

            This may involve more than simply transferring it from one place to another.
            For example: You might examine the object or a nearby receptacle to gather information. You may need to use another tool or device (like a lamp or a switch). Some tasks require you to slice, heat, cool, or clean the object using an appropriate receptacle (e.g., microwave, sink, fridge).

            If necessary, use the PickupObject action to retrieve the item, and the GotoLocation action to move to the correct place.
            Then, apply the object in a purposeful way — not just move it — but interact with the environment to fulfill the task’s actual goal.

            Hint: 
            1. If you want to heat, clean, and cool an object, after you go to that aim receptacle, do not put the object in the receptacle but do the action directly. For example, go to fridge, then cool the object with receptacle.
            2. If you want to slice an object, you should first go to the receptacle where both the sharp object and the aim object are located and ONLY pick up the sharp object then do the slice action. Don't forget to put the sharp object back to the receptacle after you finish slicing.
            3. If you want to examine or look at an object with a lamp, you should first go to the receptacle where the object is located and then pick it up and take the USE action of the lamp. You don't need to take the lamp but directly use it.
            4. If there are multiple actions needed to complete the task, you can break them down into smaller subgoals. For example, if you need to slice and then heat an object, first focus on slicing it, and then move on to heating it.

        In summary, the first stage is all about finding the object—this might involve going to an unvisited receptacle and opening it if necessary.
        
        Note: 
        1. some receptacles have numbers in their names. Always keep them as they are. For example, "towelholder1" should not be changed to "towelholder".
        2. Your initial goal should always be to go to a new location instead of put something into somewhere.
        3. Do not enter stage 2 when not finishing stage 1.

        Note: Always include :negative-preconditions in your :requirements whenever you use (not …) or delete effects, and never leave an :precondition or :effect block empty—either omit it or include at least one literal.

        You are in an environment that you must explore step by step. Your task is to build and update PDDL files for the environment using only your direct observations. Do not create or assume any objects, relationships, or details that have not been observed, and ensure you include all observations.

        The environment is a room containing various objects. Some of these objects are on, in, or contained within other objects and receptacles. You will initially be located as init_receptacle. You can assume all receptacles are freely reachable.
        
        Now, Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.
        Here are your current observations: Action: go to bathtubbasin 1
You arrive at bathtubbasin 1. On the bathtubbasin 1, you see a cloth 1, a soapbar 2, and a soapbar 1.


        Only the following actions are allowed: (There are only two types: object and receptacle)
        1. go to a receptacle
            :action GotoLocation
            :parameters (?from - receptacle ?to - receptacle)
        2. open a receptacle if it is closed
            :action OpenObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        3. close a receptacle
            :action CloseObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        4. take an object from another receptacle
            :action PickupObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        5. put object into/on/in another receptacle
            :action PutObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        6. using an object/receptacle by turning it on/off with a switch
            :action useObject
            :parameters (?o - object)
        7. heat an object using a receptacle
            :action HeatObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - microwaveReceptacle)
        8. clean an object using a receptacle
            :action CleanObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - sinkbasinReceptacle)
        9. cool an object using a receptacle
            :action CoolObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - fridgeReceptacle)
        10. slice an object using a sharp object
            :action SliceObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle ?co - object ?sharp_o - sharpObject)

        You must go to a receptacle first in order to use/open it or take/put objects from/on it.

        The process involves two main stages:

        1. Always searching for the aim Object first!!!
            In this stage, your goal is to go to and may need to open new, unvisited recepatacles until you find the object mentioned in the task. Some receptacles cannot be opened so you can directly see what objects after you go to that receptacle.

            You can only use the GotoLocation action to travel to a new location and the OpenObject action (if the receptacle is closed) to verify whether it contains the target object.

            Goal 1.1: Reach a location that has not been visited (the location should be a receptacle) using the GotoLocation action. 
                You goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (at ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be somewhere or some recepatacles not visited.

            Goal 1.2: If you already go to the recepatacle and found the recepatacle is closed, use the OpenObject action to open it and inspect the contents. 
                Your goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (opened ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be the recepatacle you want to open.

        2. After you seeing the aim object in any receptacle, using the Object to Complete the Task:
            After you have located the object (the object may have some numbers added), you should always first pick up the object from that receptacle and update your goal to focus on how the object is used to complete the task. Remember your goal is Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.. Based on different adjectives, you may need to perform different actions for the object in different ways.

            This may involve more than simply transferring it from one place to another.
            For example: You might examine the object or a nearby receptacle to gather information. You may need to use another tool or device (like a lamp or a switch). Some tasks require you to slice, heat, cool, or clean the object using an appropriate receptacle (e.g., microwave, sink, fridge).

            If necessary, use the PickupObject action to retrieve the item, and the GotoLocation action to move to the correct place.
            Then, apply the object in a purposeful way — not just move it — but interact with the environment to fulfill the task’s actual goal.

            Hint: 
            1. If you want to heat, clean, and cool an object, after you go to that aim receptacle, do not put the object in the receptacle but do the action directly. For example, go to fridge, then cool the object with receptacle.
            2. If you want to slice an object, you should first go to the receptacle where both the sharp object and the aim object are located and ONLY pick up the sharp object then do the slice action. Don't forget to put the sharp object back to the receptacle after you finish slicing.
            3. If you want to examine or look at an object with a lamp, you should first go to the receptacle where the object is located and then pick it up and take the USE action of the lamp. You don't need to take the lamp but directly use it.
            4. If there are multiple actions needed to complete the task, you can break them down into smaller subgoals. For example, if you need to slice and then heat an object, first focus on slicing it, and then move on to heating it.

        In summary, the first stage is all about finding the object—this might involve going to an unvisited receptacle and opening it if necessary.
        
        Note: 
        1. some receptacles have numbers in their names. Always keep them as they are. For example, "towelholder1" should not be changed to "towelholder".
        2. Your initial goal should always be to go to a new location instead of put something into somewhere.
        3. Do not enter stage 2 when not finishing stage 1.

        Note: Always include :negative-preconditions in your :requirements whenever you use (not …) or delete effects, and never leave an :precondition or :effect block empty—either omit it or include at least one literal.

        You are in an environment that you must explore step by step. Your task is to build and update PDDL files for the environment using only your direct observations. Do not create or assume any objects, relationships, or details that have not been observed, and ensure you include all observations.

        The environment is a room containing various objects. Some of these objects are on, in, or contained within other objects and receptacles. You will initially be located as init_receptacle. You can assume all receptacles are freely reachable.
        
        Now, Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.
        Here are your current observations: Action: go to bathtubbasin 1
You arrive at bathtubbasin 1. On the bathtubbasin 1, you see a cloth 1, a soapbar 2, and a soapbar 1.


        Only the following actions are allowed: (There are only two types: object and receptacle)
        1. go to a receptacle
            :action GotoLocation
            :parameters (?from - receptacle ?to - receptacle)
        2. open a receptacle if it is closed
            :action OpenObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        3. close a receptacle
            :action CloseObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        4. take an object from another receptacle
            :action PickupObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        5. put object into/on/in another receptacle
            :action PutObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        6. using an object/receptacle by turning it on/off with a switch
            :action useObject
            :parameters (?o - object)
        7. heat an object using a receptacle
            :action HeatObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - microwaveReceptacle)
        8. clean an object using a receptacle
            :action CleanObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - sinkbasinReceptacle)
        9. cool an object using a receptacle
            :action CoolObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - fridgeReceptacle)
        10. slice an object using a sharp object
            :action SliceObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle ?co - object ?sharp_o - sharpObject)

        You must go to a receptacle first in order to use/open it or take/put objects from/on it.

        The process involves two main stages:

        1. Always searching for the aim Object first!!!
            In this stage, your goal is to go to and may need to open new, unvisited recepatacles until you find the object mentioned in the task. Some receptacles cannot be opened so you can directly see what objects after you go to that receptacle.

            You can only use the GotoLocation action to travel to a new location and the OpenObject action (if the receptacle is closed) to verify whether it contains the target object.

            Goal 1.1: Reach a location that has not been visited (the location should be a receptacle) using the GotoLocation action. 
                You goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (at ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be somewhere or some recepatacles not visited.

            Goal 1.2: If you already go to the recepatacle and found the recepatacle is closed, use the OpenObject action to open it and inspect the contents. 
                Your goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (opened ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be the recepatacle you want to open.

        2. After you seeing the aim object in any receptacle, using the Object to Complete the Task:
            After you have located the object (the object may have some numbers added), you should always first pick up the object from that receptacle and update your goal to focus on how the object is used to complete the task. Remember your goal is Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.. Based on different adjectives, you may need to perform different actions for the object in different ways.

            This may involve more than simply transferring it from one place to another.
            For example: You might examine the object or a nearby receptacle to gather information. You may need to use another tool or device (like a lamp or a switch). Some tasks require you to slice, heat, cool, or clean the object using an appropriate receptacle (e.g., microwave, sink, fridge).

            If necessary, use the PickupObject action to retrieve the item, and the GotoLocation action to move to the correct place.
            Then, apply the object in a purposeful way — not just move it — but interact with the environment to fulfill the task’s actual goal.

            Hint: 
            1. If you want to heat, clean, and cool an object, after you go to that aim receptacle, do not put the object in the receptacle but do the action directly. For example, go to fridge, then cool the object with receptacle.
            2. If you want to slice an object, you should first go to the receptacle where both the sharp object and the aim object are located and ONLY pick up the sharp object then do the slice action. Don't forget to put the sharp object back to the receptacle after you finish slicing.
            3. If you want to examine or look at an object with a lamp, you should first go to the receptacle where the object is located and then pick it up and take the USE action of the lamp. You don't need to take the lamp but directly use it.
            4. If there are multiple actions needed to complete the task, you can break them down into smaller subgoals. For example, if you need to slice and then heat an object, first focus on slicing it, and then move on to heating it.

        In summary, the first stage is all about finding the object—this might involve going to an unvisited receptacle and opening it if necessary.
        
        Note: 
        1. some receptacles have numbers in their names. Always keep them as they are. For example, "towelholder1" should not be changed to "towelholder".
        2. Your initial goal should always be to go to a new location instead of put something into somewhere.
        3. Do not enter stage 2 when not finishing stage 1.

        Note: Always include :negative-preconditions in your :requirements whenever you use (not …) or delete effects, and never leave an :precondition or :effect block empty—either omit it or include at least one literal.

        You are in an environment that you must explore step by step. Your task is to build and update PDDL files for the environment using only your direct observations. Do not create or assume any objects, relationships, or details that have not been observed, and ensure you include all observations.

        The environment is a room containing various objects. Some of these objects are on, in, or contained within other objects and receptacles. You will initially be located as init_receptacle. You can assume all receptacles are freely reachable.
        
        Now, Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.
        Here are your current observations: Action: go to bathtubbasin 1
You arrive at bathtubbasin 1. On the bathtubbasin 1, you see a cloth 1, a soapbar 2, and a soapbar 1.


        Only the following actions are allowed: (There are only two types: object and receptacle)
        1. go to a receptacle
            :action GotoLocation
            :parameters (?from - receptacle ?to - receptacle)
        2. open a receptacle if it is closed
            :action OpenObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        3. close a receptacle
            :action CloseObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        4. take an object from another receptacle
            :action PickupObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        5. put object into/on/in another receptacle
            :action PutObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        6. using an object/receptacle by turning it on/off with a switch
            :action useObject
            :parameters (?o - object)
        7. heat an object using a receptacle
            :action HeatObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - microwaveReceptacle)
        8. clean an object using a receptacle
            :action CleanObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - sinkbasinReceptacle)
        9. cool an object using a receptacle
            :action CoolObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - fridgeReceptacle)
        10. slice an object using a sharp object
            :action SliceObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle ?co - object ?sharp_o - sharpObject)

        You must go to a receptacle first in order to use/open it or take/put objects from/on it.

        The process involves two main stages:

        1. Always searching for the aim Object first!!!
            In this stage, your goal is to go to and may need to open new, unvisited recepatacles until you find the object mentioned in the task. Some receptacles cannot be opened so you can directly see what objects after you go to that receptacle.

            You can only use the GotoLocation action to travel to a new location and the OpenObject action (if the receptacle is closed) to verify whether it contains the target object.

            Goal 1.1: Reach a location that has not been visited (the location should be a receptacle) using the GotoLocation action. 
                You goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (at ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be somewhere or some recepatacles not visited.

            Goal 1.2: If you already go to the recepatacle and found the recepatacle is closed, use the OpenObject action to open it and inspect the contents. 
                Your goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (opened ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be the recepatacle you want to open.

        2. After you seeing the aim object in any receptacle, using the Object to Complete the Task:
            After you have located the object (the object may have some numbers added), you should always first pick up the object from that receptacle and update your goal to focus on how the object is used to complete the task. Remember your goal is Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.. Based on different adjectives, you may need to perform different actions for the object in different ways.

            This may involve more than simply transferring it from one place to another.
            For example: You might examine the object or a nearby receptacle to gather information. You may need to use another tool or device (like a lamp or a switch). Some tasks require you to slice, heat, cool, or clean the object using an appropriate receptacle (e.g., microwave, sink, fridge).

            If necessary, use the PickupObject action to retrieve the item, and the GotoLocation action to move to the correct place.
            Then, apply the object in a purposeful way — not just move it — but interact with the environment to fulfill the task’s actual goal.

            Hint: 
            1. If you want to heat, clean, and cool an object, after you go to that aim receptacle, do not put the object in the receptacle but do the action directly. For example, go to fridge, then cool the object with receptacle.
            2. If you want to slice an object, you should first go to the receptacle where both the sharp object and the aim object are located and ONLY pick up the sharp object then do the slice action. Don't forget to put the sharp object back to the receptacle after you finish slicing.
            3. If you want to examine or look at an object with a lamp, you should first go to the receptacle where the object is located and then pick it up and take the USE action of the lamp. You don't need to take the lamp but directly use it.
            4. If there are multiple actions needed to complete the task, you can break them down into smaller subgoals. For example, if you need to slice and then heat an object, first focus on slicing it, and then move on to heating it.

        In summary, the first stage is all about finding the object—this might involve going to an unvisited receptacle and opening it if necessary.
        
        Note: 
        1. some receptacles have numbers in their names. Always keep them as they are. For example, "towelholder1" should not be changed to "towelholder".
        2. Your initial goal should always be to go to a new location instead of put something into somewhere.
        3. Do not enter stage 2 when not finishing stage 1.

        Note: Always include :negative-preconditions in your :requirements whenever you use (not …) or delete effects, and never leave an :precondition or :effect block empty—either omit it or include at least one literal.

            2. If you want to slice an object, you should first go to the receptacle where both the sharp object and the aim object are located and ONLY pick up the sharp object then do the slice action. Don't forget to put the sharp object back to the receptacle after you finish slicing.
            3. If you want to examine or look at an object with a lamp, you should first go to the receptacle where the object is located and then pick it up and take the USE action of the lamp. You don't need to take the lamp but directly use it.
            4. If there are multiple actions needed to complete the task, you can break them down into smaller subgoals. For example, if you need to slice and then heat an object, first focus on slicing it, and then move on to heating it.

        In summary, the first stage is all about finding the object—this might involve going to an unvisited receptacle and opening it if necessary.
        
        Note: 
        1. some receptacles have numbers in their names. Always keep them as they are. For example, "towelholder1" should not be changed to "towelholder".
        2. Your initial goal should always be to go to a new location instead of put something into somewhere.
        3. Do not enter stage 2 when not finishing stage 1.

        Note: Always include :negative-preconditions in your :requirements whenever you use (not …) or delete effects, and never leave an :precondition or :effect block empty—either omit it or include at least one literal.

        You are in an environment that you must explore step by step. Your task is to build and update PDDL files for the environment using only your direct observations. Do not create or assume any objects, relationships, or details that have not been observed, and ensure you include all observations.

        The environment is a room containing various objects. Some of these objects are on, in, or contained within other objects and receptacles. You will initially be located as init_receptacle. You can assume all receptacles are freely reachable.
        
        Now, Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.
        Here are your current observations: Action: go to drawer 1
You arrive at drawer 1. On the drawer 1, you see nothing.


        Only the following actions are allowed: (There are only two types: object and receptacle)
        1. go to a receptacle
            :action GotoLocation
            :parameters (?from - receptacle ?to - receptacle)
        2. open a receptacle if it is closed
            :action OpenObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        3. close a receptacle
            :action CloseObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        4. take an object from another receptacle
            :action PickupObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        5. put object into/on/in another receptacle
            :action PutObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        6. using an object/receptacle by turning it on/off with a switch
            :action useObject
            :parameters (?o - object)
        7. heat an object using a receptacle
            :action HeatObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - microwaveReceptacle)
        8. clean an object using a receptacle
            :action CleanObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - sinkbasinReceptacle)
        9. cool an object using a receptacle
            :action CoolObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - fridgeReceptacle)
        10. slice an object using a sharp object
            :action SliceObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle ?co - object ?sharp_o - sharpObject)

        You must go to a receptacle first in order to use/open it or take/put objects from/on it.

        The process involves two main stages:

        1. Always searching for the aim Object first!!!
            In this stage, your goal is to go to and may need to open new, unvisited recepatacles until you find the object mentioned in the task. Some receptacles cannot be opened so you can directly see what objects after you go to that receptacle.

            You can only use the GotoLocation action to travel to a new location and the OpenObject action (if the receptacle is closed) to verify whether it contains the target object.

            Goal 1.1: Reach a location that has not been visited (the location should be a receptacle) using the GotoLocation action. 
                You goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (at ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be somewhere or some recepatacles not visited.

            Goal 1.2: If you already go to the recepatacle and found the recepatacle is closed, use the OpenObject action to open it and inspect the contents. 
                Your goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (opened ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be the recepatacle you want to open.

        2. After you seeing the aim object in any receptacle, using the Object to Complete the Task:
            After you have located the object (the object may have some numbers added), you should always first pick up the object from that receptacle and update your goal to focus on how the object is used to complete the task. Remember your goal is Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.. Based on different adjectives, you may need to perform different actions for the object in different ways.

            This may involve more than simply transferring it from one place to another.
            For example: You might examine the object or a nearby receptacle to gather information. You may need to use another tool or device (like a lamp or a switch). Some tasks require you to slice, heat, cool, or clean the object using an appropriate receptacle (e.g., microwave, sink, fridge).

            If necessary, use the PickupObject action to retrieve the item, and the GotoLocation action to move to the correct place.
            Then, apply the object in a purposeful way — not just move it — but interact with the environment to fulfill the task’s actual goal.

            Hint: 
            1. If you want to heat, clean, and cool an object, after you go to that aim receptacle, do not put the object in the receptacle but do the action directly. For example, go to fridge, then cool the object with receptacle.
            2. If you want to slice an object, you should first go to the receptacle where both the sharp object and the aim object are located and ONLY pick up the sharp object then do the slice action. Don't forget to put the sharp object back to the receptacle after you finish slicing.
            3. If you want to examine or look at an object with a lamp, you should first go to the receptacle where the object is located and then pick it up and take the USE action of the lamp. You don't need to take the lamp but directly use it.
            4. If there are multiple actions needed to complete the task, you can break them down into smaller subgoals. For example, if you need to slice and then heat an object, first focus on slicing it, and then move on to heating it.

        In summary, the first stage is all about finding the object—this might involve going to an unvisited receptacle and opening it if necessary.
        
        Note: 
        1. some receptacles have numbers in their names. Always keep them as they are. For example, "towelholder1" should not be changed to "towelholder".
        2. Your initial goal should always be to go to a new location instead of put something into somewhere.
        3. Do not enter stage 2 when not finishing stage 1.

        Note: Always include :negative-preconditions in your :requirements whenever you use (not …) or delete effects, and never leave an :precondition or :effect block empty—either omit it or include at least one literal.

        You are in an environment that you must explore step by step. Your task is to build and update PDDL files for the environment using only your direct observations. Do not create or assume any objects, relationships, or details that have not been observed, and ensure you include all observations.

        The environment is a room containing various objects. Some of these objects are on, in, or contained within other objects and receptacles. You will initially be located as init_receptacle. You can assume all receptacles are freely reachable.
        
        Now, Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.
        Here are your current observations: Action: go to bathtubbasin 1
You arrive at bathtubbasin 1. On the bathtubbasin 1, you see a cloth 1, a soapbar 2, and a soapbar 1.


        Only the following actions are allowed: (There are only two types: object and receptacle)
        1. go to a receptacle
            :action GotoLocation
            :parameters (?from - receptacle ?to - receptacle)
        2. open a receptacle if it is closed
            :action OpenObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        3. close a receptacle
            :action CloseObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        4. take an object from another receptacle
            :action PickupObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        5. put object into/on/in another receptacle
            :action PutObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        6. using an object/receptacle by turning it on/off with a switch
            :action useObject
            :parameters (?o - object)
        7. heat an object using a receptacle
            :action HeatObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - microwaveReceptacle)
        8. clean an object using a receptacle
            :action CleanObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - sinkbasinReceptacle)
        9. cool an object using a receptacle
            :action CoolObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - fridgeReceptacle)
        10. slice an object using a sharp object
            :action SliceObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle ?co - object ?sharp_o - sharpObject)

        You must go to a receptacle first in order to use/open it or take/put objects from/on it.

        The process involves two main stages:

        1. Always searching for the aim Object first!!!
            In this stage, your goal is to go to and may need to open new, unvisited recepatacles until you find the object mentioned in the task. Some receptacles cannot be opened so you can directly see what objects after you go to that receptacle.

            You can only use the GotoLocation action to travel to a new location and the OpenObject action (if the receptacle is closed) to verify whether it contains the target object.

            Goal 1.1: Reach a location that has not been visited (the location should be a receptacle) using the GotoLocation action. 
                You goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (at ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be somewhere or some recepatacles not visited.

            Goal 1.2: If you already go to the recepatacle and found the recepatacle is closed, use the OpenObject action to open it and inspect the contents. 
                Your goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (opened ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be the recepatacle you want to open.

        2. After you seeing the aim object in any receptacle, using the Object to Complete the Task:
            After you have located the object (the object may have some numbers added), you should always first pick up the object from that receptacle and update your goal to focus on how the object is used to complete the task. Remember your goal is Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.. Based on different adjectives, you may need to perform different actions for the object in different ways.

            This may involve more than simply transferring it from one place to another.
            For example: You might examine the object or a nearby receptacle to gather information. You may need to use another tool or device (like a lamp or a switch). Some tasks require you to slice, heat, cool, or clean the object using an appropriate receptacle (e.g., microwave, sink, fridge).

            If necessary, use the PickupObject action to retrieve the item, and the GotoLocation action to move to the correct place.
            Then, apply the object in a purposeful way — not just move it — but interact with the environment to fulfill the task’s actual goal.

            Hint: 
            1. If you want to heat, clean, and cool an object, after you go to that aim receptacle, do not put the object in the receptacle but do the action directly. For example, go to fridge, then cool the object with receptacle.
            2. If you want to slice an object, you should first go to the receptacle where both the sharp object and the aim object are located and ONLY pick up the sharp object then do the slice action. Don't forget to put the sharp object back to the receptacle after you finish slicing.
            3. If you want to examine or look at an object with a lamp, you should first go to the receptacle where the object is located and then pick it up and take the USE action of the lamp. You don't need to take the lamp but directly use it.
            4. If there are multiple actions needed to complete the task, you can break them down into smaller subgoals. For example, if you need to slice and then heat an object, first focus on slicing it, and then move on to heating it.

        In summary, the first stage is all about finding the object—this might involve going to an unvisited receptacle and opening it if necessary.
        
        Note: 
        1. some receptacles have numbers in their names. Always keep them as they are. For example, "towelholder1" should not be changed to "towelholder".
        2. Your initial goal should always be to go to a new location instead of put something into somewhere.
        3. Do not enter stage 2 when not finishing stage 1.

        Note: Always include :negative-preconditions in your :requirements whenever you use (not …) or delete effects, and never leave an :precondition or :effect block empty—either omit it or include at least one literal.

        The format should strictly be:

            "pf": "..."
            }
    
        You are in an environment that you must explore step by step. Your task is to build and update PDDL files for the environment using only your direct observations. Do not create or assume any objects, relationships, or details that have not been observed, and ensure you include all observations.

        The environment is a room containing various objects. Some of these objects are on, in, or contained within other objects and receptacles. You will initially be located as init_receptacle. You can assume all receptacles are freely reachable.
        
        Now, Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.
        Here are your current observations: Action: go to bathtubbasin 1
You arrive at bathtubbasin 1. On the bathtubbasin 1, you see a cloth 1, a soapbar 2, and a soapbar 1.


        Only the following actions are allowed: (There are only two types: object and receptacle)
        1. go to a receptacle
            :action GotoLocation
            :parameters (?from - receptacle ?to - receptacle)
        2. open a receptacle if it is closed
            :action OpenObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        3. close a receptacle
            :action CloseObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        4. take an object from another receptacle
            :action PickupObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        5. put object into/on/in another receptacle
            :action PutObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        6. using an object/receptacle by turning it on/off with a switch
            :action useObject
            :parameters (?o - object)
        7. heat an object using a receptacle
            :action HeatObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - microwaveReceptacle)
        8. clean an object using a receptacle
            :action CleanObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - sinkbasinReceptacle)
        9. cool an object using a receptacle
            :action CoolObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - fridgeReceptacle)
        10. slice an object using a sharp object
            :action SliceObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle ?co - object ?sharp_o - sharpObject)

        You must go to a receptacle first in order to use/open it or take/put objects from/on it.

        The process involves two main stages:

        1. Always searching for the aim Object first!!!
            In this stage, your goal is to go to and may need to open new, unvisited recepatacles until you find the object mentioned in the task. Some receptacles cannot be opened so you can directly see what objects after you go to that receptacle.

            You can only use the GotoLocation action to travel to a new location and the OpenObject action (if the receptacle is closed) to verify whether it contains the target object.

            Goal 1.1: Reach a location that has not been visited (the location should be a receptacle) using the GotoLocation action. 
                You goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (at ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be somewhere or some recepatacles not visited.

            Goal 1.2: If you already go to the recepatacle and found the recepatacle is closed, use the OpenObject action to open it and inspect the contents. 
                Your goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (opened ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be the recepatacle you want to open.

        2. After you seeing the aim object in any receptacle, using the Object to Complete the Task:
            After you have located the object (the object may have some numbers added), you should always first pick up the object from that receptacle and update your goal to focus on how the object is used to complete the task. Remember your goal is Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.. Based on different adjectives, you may need to perform different actions for the object in different ways.

            This may involve more than simply transferring it from one place to another.
            For example: You might examine the object or a nearby receptacle to gather information. You may need to use another tool or device (like a lamp or a switch). Some tasks require you to slice, heat, cool, or clean the object using an appropriate receptacle (e.g., microwave, sink, fridge).

            If necessary, use the PickupObject action to retrieve the item, and the GotoLocation action to move to the correct place.
            Then, apply the object in a purposeful way — not just move it — but interact with the environment to fulfill the task’s actual goal.

            Hint: 
            1. If you want to heat, clean, and cool an object, after you go to that aim receptacle, do not put the object in the receptacle but do the action directly. For example, go to fridge, then cool the object with receptacle.
            2. If you want to slice an object, you should first go to the receptacle where both the sharp object and the aim object are located and ONLY pick up the sharp object then do the slice action. Don't forget to put the sharp object back to the receptacle after you finish slicing.
            3. If you want to examine or look at an object with a lamp, you should first go to the receptacle where the object is located and then pick it up and take the USE action of the lamp. You don't need to take the lamp but directly use it.
            4. If there are multiple actions needed to complete the task, you can break them down into smaller subgoals. For example, if you need to slice and then heat an object, first focus on slicing it, and then move on to heating it.

        In summary, the first stage is all about finding the object—this might involve going to an unvisited receptacle and opening it if necessary.
        
        Note: 
        1. some receptacles have numbers in their names. Always keep them as they are. For example, "towelholder1" should not be changed to "towelholder".
        2. Your initial goal should always be to go to a new location instead of put something into somewhere.
        3. Do not enter stage 2 when not finishing stage 1.

        Note: Always include :negative-preconditions in your :requirements whenever you use (not …) or delete effects, and never leave an :precondition or :effect block empty—either omit it or include at least one literal.

            In this stage, your goal is to go to and may need to open new, unvisited recepatacles until you find the object mentioned in the task. Some receptacles cannot be opened so you can directly see what objects after you go to that receptacle.

            You can only use the GotoLocation action to travel to a new location and the OpenObject action (if the receptacle is closed) to verify whether it contains the target object.

            Goal 1.1: Reach a location that has not been visited (the location should be a receptacle) using the GotoLocation action. 
                You goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (at ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be somewhere or some recepatacles not visited.

            Goal 1.2: If you already go to the recepatacle and found the recepatacle is closed, use the OpenObject action to open it and inspect the contents. 
                Your goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (opened ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be the recepatacle you want to open.

        2. After you seeing the aim object in any receptacle, using the Object to Complete the Task:
            After you have located the object (the object may have some numbers added), you should always first pick up the object from that receptacle and update your goal to focus on how the object is used to complete the task. Remember your goal is Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.. Based on different adjectives, you may need to perform different actions for the object in different ways.

            This may involve more than simply transferring it from one place to another.
            For example: You might examine the object or a nearby receptacle to gather information. You may need to use another tool or device (like a lamp or a switch). Some tasks require you to slice, heat, cool, or clean the object using an appropriate receptacle (e.g., microwave, sink, fridge).

            If necessary, use the PickupObject action to retrieve the item, and the GotoLocation action to move to the correct place.
            Then, apply the object in a purposeful way — not just move it — but interact with the environment to fulfill the task’s actual goal.

            Hint: 
            1. If you want to heat, clean, and cool an object, after you go to that aim receptacle, do not put the object in the receptacle but do the action directly. For example, go to fridge, then cool the object with receptacle.
            2. If you want to slice an object, you should first go to the receptacle where both the sharp object and the aim object are located and ONLY pick up the sharp object then do the slice action. Don't forget to put the sharp object back to the receptacle after you finish slicing.
            3. If you want to examine or look at an object with a lamp, you should first go to the receptacle where the object is located and then pick it up and take the USE action of the lamp. You don't need to take the lamp but directly use it.
            4. If there are multiple actions needed to complete the task, you can break them down into smaller subgoals. For example, if you need to slice and then heat an object, first focus on slicing it, and then move on to heating it.

        In summary, the first stage is all about finding the object—this might involve going to an unvisited receptacle and opening it if necessary.
        
        Note: 
        1. some receptacles have numbers in their names. Always keep them as they are. For example, "towelholder1" should not be changed to "towelholder".
        2. Your initial goal should always be to go to a new location instead of put something into somewhere.
        3. Do not enter stage 2 when not finishing stage 1.

        Note: Always include :negative-preconditions in your :requirements whenever you use (not …) or delete effects, and never leave an :precondition or :effect block empty—either omit it or include at least one literal.

        Now, Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.
        Here are your current observations: Action: go to bathtubbasin 1
You arrive at bathtubbasin 1. On the bathtubbasin 1, you see a cloth 1, a soapbar 2, and a soapbar 1.


        Only the following actions are allowed: (There are only two types: object and receptacle)
        1. go to a receptacle
            :action GotoLocation
            :parameters (?from - receptacle ?to - receptacle)
        2. open a receptacle if it is closed

            :action SliceObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle ?co - object ?sharp_o - sharpObject)

        You must go to a receptacle first in order to use/open it or take/put objects from/on it.

        The process involves two main stages:

        1. Always searching for the aim Object first!!!
            In this stage, your goal is to go to and may need to open new, unvisited recepatacles until you find the object mentioned in the task. Some receptacles cannot be opened so you can directly see what objects after you go to that receptacle.

            Goal 1.1: Reach a location that has not been visited (the location should be a receptacle) using the GotoLocation action. 
                You goal should look like this:

                ) where recepatacle should be somewhere or some recepatacles not visited.

            Goal 1.2: If you already go to the recepatacle and found the recepatacle is closed, use the OpenObject action to open it and inspect the contents.

                ) where recepatacle should be the recepatacle you want to open.

        2. After you seeing the aim object in any receptacle, using the Object to Complete the Task:
            After you have located the object (the object may have some numbers added), you should always first pick up the object from that receptacle and update your goal to focus on how the object is used to complete the task. Remember your goal is Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.. Based on different adjectives, you may need to perform different actions for the object in different ways.

            This may involve more than simply transferring it from one place to another.
            For example: You might examine the object or a nearby receptacle to gather information. You may need to use another tool or device (like a lamp or a switch). Some tasks require you to slice, heat, cool, or clean the object using an appropriate receptacle (e.g., microwave, sink, fridge).

            If necessary, use the PickupObject action to retrieve the item, and the GotoLocation action to move to the correct place.
            Then, apply the object in a purposeful way — not just move it — but interact with the environment to fulfill the task’s actual goal.

            1. If you want to heat, clean, and cool an object, after you go to that aim receptacle, do not put the object in the receptacle but do the action directly. For example, go to fridge, then cool the object with receptacle.
            2. If you want to slice an object, you should first go to the receptacle where both the sharp object and the aim object are located and ONLY pick up the sharp object then do the slice action. Don't forget to put the sharp object back to the receptacle after you finish slicing.
            3. If you want to examine or look at an object with a lamp, you should first go to the receptacle where the object is located and then pick it up and take the USE action of the lamp. You don't need to take the lamp but directly use it.
            4. If there are multiple actions needed to complete the task, you can break them down into smaller subgoals. For example, if you need to slice and then heat an object, first focus on slicing it, and then move on to heating it.

        In summary, the first stage is all about finding the object—this might involve going to an unvisited receptacle and opening it if necessary.
        
        Note:

        2. Your initial goal should always be to go to a new location instead of put something into somewhere.
        3. Do not enter stage 2 when not finishing stage 1.

        You are in an environment that you must explore step by step. Your task is to build and update PDDL files for the environment using only your direct observations. Do not create or assume any objects, relationships, or details that have not been observed, and ensure you include all observations.

        The environment is a room containing various objects. Some of these objects are on, in, or contained within other objects and receptacles. You will initially be located as init_receptacle. You can assume all receptacles are freely reachable.
        
        Now, Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.
        Here are your current observations: Action: take cloth 1 from bathtubbasin 1
You pick up the cloth 1 from the bathtubbasin 1.


        Only the following actions are allowed: (There are only two types: object and receptacle)
        1. go to a receptacle
            :action GotoLocation
            :parameters (?from - receptacle ?to - receptacle)
        2. open a receptacle if it is closed
            :action OpenObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        3. close a receptacle
            :action CloseObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        4. take an object from another receptacle
            :action PickupObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        5. put object into/on/in another receptacle
            :action PutObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        6. using an object/receptacle by turning it on/off with a switch
            :action useObject
            :parameters (?o - object)
        7. heat an object using a receptacle
            :action HeatObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - microwaveReceptacle)
        8. clean an object using a receptacle
            :action CleanObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - sinkbasinReceptacle)
        9. cool an object using a receptacle
            :action CoolObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - fridgeReceptacle)
        10. slice an object using a sharp object
            :action SliceObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle ?co - object ?sharp_o - sharpObject)

        You must go to a receptacle first in order to use/open it or take/put objects from/on it.

        The process involves two main stages:

        1. Always searching for the aim Object first!!!
            In this stage, your goal is to go to and may need to open new, unvisited recepatacles until you find the object mentioned in the task. Some receptacles cannot be opened so you can directly see what objects after you go to that receptacle.

            You can only use the GotoLocation action to travel to a new location and the OpenObject action (if the receptacle is closed) to verify whether it contains the target object.

            Goal 1.1: Reach a location that has not been visited (the location should be a receptacle) using the GotoLocation action. 
                You goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (at ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be somewhere or some recepatacles not visited.

            Goal 1.2: If you already go to the recepatacle and found the recepatacle is closed, use the OpenObject action to open it and inspect the contents. 
                Your goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (opened ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be the recepatacle you want to open.

        2. After you seeing the aim object in any receptacle, using the Object to Complete the Task:
            After you have located the object (the object may have some numbers added), you should always first pick up the object from that receptacle and update your goal to focus on how the object is used to complete the task. Remember your goal is Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.. Based on different adjectives, you may need to perform different actions for the object in different ways.

            This may involve more than simply transferring it from one place to another.
            For example: You might examine the object or a nearby receptacle to gather information. You may need to use another tool or device (like a lamp or a switch). Some tasks require you to slice, heat, cool, or clean the object using an appropriate receptacle (e.g., microwave, sink, fridge).

            If necessary, use the PickupObject action to retrieve the item, and the GotoLocation action to move to the correct place.
            Then, apply the object in a purposeful way — not just move it — but interact with the environment to fulfill the task’s actual goal.

            Hint: 
            1. If you want to heat, clean, and cool an object, after you go to that aim receptacle, do not put the object in the receptacle but do the action directly. For example, go to fridge, then cool the object with receptacle.
            2. If you want to slice an object, you should first go to the receptacle where both the sharp object and the aim object are located and ONLY pick up the sharp object then do the slice action. Don't forget to put the sharp object back to the receptacle after you finish slicing.
            3. If you want to examine or look at an object with a lamp, you should first go to the receptacle where the object is located and then pick it up and take the USE action of the lamp. You don't need to take the lamp but directly use it.
            4. If there are multiple actions needed to complete the task, you can break them down into smaller subgoals. For example, if you need to slice and then heat an object, first focus on slicing it, and then move on to heating it.

        In summary, the first stage is all about finding the object—this might involve going to an unvisited receptacle and opening it if necessary.
        
        Note: 
        1. some receptacles have numbers in their names. Always keep them as they are. For example, "towelholder1" should not be changed to "towelholder".
        2. Your initial goal should always be to go to a new location instead of put something into somewhere.
        3. Do not enter stage 2 when not finishing stage 1.

        Note: Always include :negative-preconditions in your :requirements whenever you use (not …) or delete effects, and never leave an :precondition or :effect block empty—either omit it or include at least one literal.

        You are in an environment that you must explore step by step. Your task is to build and update PDDL files for the environment using only your direct observations. Do not create or assume any objects, relationships, or details that have not been observed, and ensure you include all observations.

        The environment is a room containing various objects. Some of these objects are on, in, or contained within other objects and receptacles. You will initially be located as init_receptacle. You can assume all receptacles are freely reachable.
        
        Now, Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.
        Here are your current observations: Action: clean cloth 1 with bathtubbasin 1
Nothing happens.


        Only the following actions are allowed: (There are only two types: object and receptacle)
        1. go to a receptacle
            :action GotoLocation
            :parameters (?from - receptacle ?to - receptacle)
        2. open a receptacle if it is closed
            :action OpenObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        3. close a receptacle
            :action CloseObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        4. take an object from another receptacle
            :action PickupObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        5. put object into/on/in another receptacle
            :action PutObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        6. using an object/receptacle by turning it on/off with a switch
            :action useObject
            :parameters (?o - object)
        7. heat an object using a receptacle
            :action HeatObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - microwaveReceptacle)
        8. clean an object using a receptacle
            :action CleanObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - sinkbasinReceptacle)
        9. cool an object using a receptacle
            :action CoolObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - fridgeReceptacle)
        10. slice an object using a sharp object
            :action SliceObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle ?co - object ?sharp_o - sharpObject)

        You must go to a receptacle first in order to use/open it or take/put objects from/on it.

        The process involves two main stages:

        1. Always searching for the aim Object first!!!
            In this stage, your goal is to go to and may need to open new, unvisited recepatacles until you find the object mentioned in the task. Some receptacles cannot be opened so you can directly see what objects after you go to that receptacle.

            You can only use the GotoLocation action to travel to a new location and the OpenObject action (if the receptacle is closed) to verify whether it contains the target object.

            Goal 1.1: Reach a location that has not been visited (the location should be a receptacle) using the GotoLocation action. 
                You goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (at ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be somewhere or some recepatacles not visited.

            Goal 1.2: If you already go to the recepatacle and found the recepatacle is closed, use the OpenObject action to open it and inspect the contents. 
                Your goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (opened ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be the recepatacle you want to open.

        2. After you seeing the aim object in any receptacle, using the Object to Complete the Task:
            After you have located the object (the object may have some numbers added), you should always first pick up the object from that receptacle and update your goal to focus on how the object is used to complete the task. Remember your goal is Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.. Based on different adjectives, you may need to perform different actions for the object in different ways.

            This may involve more than simply transferring it from one place to another.
            For example: You might examine the object or a nearby receptacle to gather information. You may need to use another tool or device (like a lamp or a switch). Some tasks require you to slice, heat, cool, or clean the object using an appropriate receptacle (e.g., microwave, sink, fridge).

            If necessary, use the PickupObject action to retrieve the item, and the GotoLocation action to move to the correct place.
            Then, apply the object in a purposeful way — not just move it — but interact with the environment to fulfill the task’s actual goal.

            Hint: 
            1. If you want to heat, clean, and cool an object, after you go to that aim receptacle, do not put the object in the receptacle but do the action directly. For example, go to fridge, then cool the object with receptacle.
            2. If you want to slice an object, you should first go to the receptacle where both the sharp object and the aim object are located and ONLY pick up the sharp object then do the slice action. Don't forget to put the sharp object back to the receptacle after you finish slicing.
            3. If you want to examine or look at an object with a lamp, you should first go to the receptacle where the object is located and then pick it up and take the USE action of the lamp. You don't need to take the lamp but directly use it.
            4. If there are multiple actions needed to complete the task, you can break them down into smaller subgoals. For example, if you need to slice and then heat an object, first focus on slicing it, and then move on to heating it.

        In summary, the first stage is all about finding the object—this might involve going to an unvisited receptacle and opening it if necessary.
        
        Note: 
        1. some receptacles have numbers in their names. Always keep them as they are. For example, "towelholder1" should not be changed to "towelholder".
        2. Your initial goal should always be to go to a new location instead of put something into somewhere.
        3. Do not enter stage 2 when not finishing stage 1.

        Note: Always include :negative-preconditions in your :requirements whenever you use (not …) or delete effects, and never leave an :precondition or :effect block empty—either omit it or include at least one literal.

Do not create or assume any objects, relationships, or details that have not been observed, and ensure you include all observations.

        The environment is a room containing various objects. Some of these objects are on, in, or contained within other objects and receptacles. You will initially be located as init_receptacle. You can assume all receptacles are freely reachable.
        
        Now, Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.
        Here are your current observations: Action: go to sinkbasin 1
You arrive at sinkbasin 1. On the sinkbasin 1, you see nothing.


        Only the following actions are allowed: (There are only two types: object and receptacle)
        1. go to a receptacle
            :action GotoLocation
            :parameters (?from - receptacle ?to - receptacle)
        2. open a receptacle if it is closed
            :action OpenObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        3. close a receptacle
            :action CloseObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        4. take an object from another receptacle
            :action PickupObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        5. put object into/on/in another receptacle
            :action PutObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        6. using an object/receptacle by turning it on/off with a switch
            :action useObject
            :parameters (?o - object)
        7. heat an object using a receptacle
            :action HeatObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - microwaveReceptacle)
        8. clean an object using a receptacle
            :action CleanObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - sinkbasinReceptacle)
        9. cool an object using a receptacle
            :action CoolObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - fridgeReceptacle)
        10. slice an object using a sharp object
            :action SliceObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle ?co - object ?sharp_o - sharpObject)

        You must go to a receptacle first in order to use/open it or take/put objects from/on it.

        The process involves two main stages:

        1. Always searching for the aim Object first!!!
            In this stage, your goal is to go to and may need to open new, unvisited recepatacles until you find the object mentioned in the task. Some receptacles cannot be opened so you can directly see what objects after you go to that receptacle.

            You can only use the GotoLocation action to travel to a new location and the OpenObject action (if the receptacle is closed) to verify whether it contains the target object.

            Goal 1.1: Reach a location that has not been visited (the location should be a receptacle) using the GotoLocation action. 
                You goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (at ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be somewhere or some recepatacles not visited.

            Goal 1.2: If you already go to the recepatacle and found the recepatacle is closed, use the OpenObject action to open it and inspect the contents. 
                Your goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (opened ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be the recepatacle you want to open.

        2. After you seeing the aim object in any receptacle, using the Object to Complete the Task:
            After you have located the object (the object may have some numbers added), you should always first pick up the object from that receptacle and update your goal to focus on how the object is used to complete the task. Remember your goal is Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.. Based on different adjectives, you may need to perform different actions for the object in different ways.

            This may involve more than simply transferring it from one place to another.
            For example: You might examine the object or a nearby receptacle to gather information. You may need to use another tool or device (like a lamp or a switch). Some tasks require you to slice, heat, cool, or clean the object using an appropriate receptacle (e.g., microwave, sink, fridge).

            If necessary, use the PickupObject action to retrieve the item, and the GotoLocation action to move to the correct place.
            Then, apply the object in a purposeful way — not just move it — but interact with the environment to fulfill the task’s actual goal.

            Hint: 
            1. If you want to heat, clean, and cool an object, after you go to that aim receptacle, do not put the object in the receptacle but do the action directly. For example, go to fridge, then cool the object with receptacle.
            2. If you want to slice an object, you should first go to the receptacle where both the sharp object and the aim object are located and ONLY pick up the sharp object then do the slice action. Don't forget to put the sharp object back to the receptacle after you finish slicing.
            3. If you want to examine or look at an object with a lamp, you should first go to the receptacle where the object is located and then pick it up and take the USE action of the lamp. You don't need to take the lamp but directly use it.
            4. If there are multiple actions needed to complete the task, you can break them down into smaller subgoals. For example, if you need to slice and then heat an object, first focus on slicing it, and then move on to heating it.

        In summary, the first stage is all about finding the object—this might involve going to an unvisited receptacle and opening it if necessary.
        
        Note: 
        1. some receptacles have numbers in their names. Always keep them as they are. For example, "towelholder1" should not be changed to "towelholder".
        2. Your initial goal should always be to go to a new location instead of put something into somewhere.
        3. Do not enter stage 2 when not finishing stage 1.

        Note: Always include :negative-preconditions in your :requirements whenever you use (not …) or delete effects, and never leave an :precondition or :effect block empty—either omit it or include at least one literal.

        The process involves two main stages:

        1. Always searching for the aim Object first!!!
            In this stage, your goal is to go to and may need to open new, unvisited recepatacles until you find the object mentioned in the task. Some receptacles cannot be opened so you can directly see what objects after you go to that receptacle.

            You can only use the GotoLocation action to travel to a new location and the OpenObject action (if the receptacle is closed) to verify whether it contains the target object.

            Goal 1.1: Reach a location that has not been visited (the location should be a receptacle) using the GotoLocation action. 
                You goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (at ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be somewhere or some recepatacles not visited.

            Goal 1.2: If you already go to the recepatacle and found the recepatacle is closed, use the OpenObject action to open it and inspect the contents. 
                Your goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (opened ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be the recepatacle you want to open.

        2. After you seeing the aim object in any receptacle, using the Object to Complete the Task:
            After you have located the object (the object may have some numbers added), you should always first pick up the object from that receptacle and update your goal to focus on how the object is used to complete the task. Remember your goal is Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.. Based on different adjectives, you may need to perform different actions for the object in different ways.

            This may involve more than simply transferring it from one place to another.
            For example: You might examine the object or a nearby receptacle to gather information. You may need to use another tool or device (like a lamp or a switch). Some tasks require you to slice, heat, cool, or clean the object using an appropriate receptacle (e.g., microwave, sink, fridge).

            If necessary, use the PickupObject action to retrieve the item, and the GotoLocation action to move to the correct place.
            Then, apply the object in a purposeful way — not just move it — but interact with the environment to fulfill the task’s actual goal.

            Hint: 
            1. If you want to heat, clean, and cool an object, after you go to that aim receptacle, do not put the object in the receptacle but do the action directly. For example, go to fridge, then cool the object with receptacle.
            2. If you want to slice an object, you should first go to the receptacle where both the sharp object and the aim object are located and ONLY pick up the sharp object then do the slice action. Don't forget to put the sharp object back to the receptacle after you finish slicing.
            3. If you want to examine or look at an object with a lamp, you should first go to the receptacle where the object is located and then pick it up and take the USE action of the lamp. You don't need to take the lamp but directly use it.
            4. If there are multiple actions needed to complete the task, you can break them down into smaller subgoals. For example, if you need to slice and then heat an object, first focus on slicing it, and then move on to heating it.

        In summary, the first stage is all about finding the object—this might involve going to an unvisited receptacle and opening it if necessary.
        
        Note: 
        1. some receptacles have numbers in their names. Always keep them as they are. For example, "towelholder1" should not be changed to "towelholder".
        2. Your initial goal should always be to go to a new location instead of put something into somewhere.
        3. Do not enter stage 2 when not finishing stage 1.

        Note: Always include :negative-preconditions in your :requirements whenever you use (not …) or delete effects, and never leave an :precondition or :effect block empty—either omit it or include at least one literal.

        Now, Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.
        Here are your current observations: Action: go to toilet 1
You arrive at toilet 1. On the toilet 1, you see nothing.


        Only the following actions are allowed: (There are only two types: object and receptacle)
        1. go to a receptacle

            :parameters (?r - receptacle ?co - object ?sharp_o - sharpObject)

        You must go to a receptacle first in order to use/open it or take/put objects from/on it.

        The process involves two main stages:

        1. Always searching for the aim Object first!!!
            In this stage, your goal is to go to and may need to open new, unvisited recepatacles until you find the object mentioned in the task. Some receptacles cannot be opened so you can directly see what objects after you go to that receptacle.

            You can only use the GotoLocation action to travel to a new location and the OpenObject action (if the receptacle is closed) to verify whether it contains the target object.

            Goal 1.1: Reach a location that has not been visited (the location should be a receptacle) using the GotoLocation action. 
                You goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (at ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be somewhere or some recepatacles not visited.

            Goal 1.2: If you already go to the recepatacle and found the recepatacle is closed, use the OpenObject action to open it and inspect the contents. 
                Your goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (opened ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be the recepatacle you want to open.

        2. After you seeing the aim object in any receptacle, using the Object to Complete the Task:
            After you have located the object (the object may have some numbers added), you should always first pick up the object from that receptacle and update your goal to focus on how the object is used to complete the task. Remember your goal is Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.. Based on different adjectives, you may need to perform different actions for the object in different ways.

            This may involve more than simply transferring it from one place to another.
            For example: You might examine the object or a nearby receptacle to gather information. You may need to use another tool or device (like a lamp or a switch). Some tasks require you to slice, heat, cool, or clean the object using an appropriate receptacle (e.g., microwave, sink, fridge).

            If necessary, use the PickupObject action to retrieve the item, and the GotoLocation action to move to the correct place.
            Then, apply the object in a purposeful way — not just move it — but interact with the environment to fulfill the task’s actual goal.

            Hint: 
            1. If you want to heat, clean, and cool an object, after you go to that aim receptacle, do not put the object in the receptacle but do the action directly. For example, go to fridge, then cool the object with receptacle.
            2. If you want to slice an object, you should first go to the receptacle where both the sharp object and the aim object are located and ONLY pick up the sharp object then do the slice action. Don't forget to put the sharp object back to the receptacle after you finish slicing.
            3. If you want to examine or look at an object with a lamp, you should first go to the receptacle where the object is located and then pick it up and take the USE action of the lamp. You don't need to take the lamp but directly use it.
            4. If there are multiple actions needed to complete the task, you can break them down into smaller subgoals. For example, if you need to slice and then heat an object, first focus on slicing it, and then move on to heating it.

        In summary, the first stage is all about finding the object—this might involve going to an unvisited receptacle and opening it if necessary.
        
        Note: 
        1. some receptacles have numbers in their names. Always keep them as they are. For example, "towelholder1" should not be changed to "towelholder".
        2. Your initial goal should always be to go to a new location instead of put something into somewhere.
        3. Do not enter stage 2 when not finishing stage 1.

        Note: Always include :negative-preconditions in your :requirements whenever you use (not …) or delete effects, and never leave an :precondition or :effect block empty—either omit it or include at least one literal.

        You are in an environment that you must explore step by step. Your task is to build and update PDDL files for the environment using only your direct observations. Do not create or assume any objects, relationships, or details that have not been observed, and ensure you include all observations.

        The environment is a room containing various objects. Some of these objects are on, in, or contained within other objects and receptacles. You will initially be located as init_receptacle. You can assume all receptacles are freely reachable.
        
        Now, Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.
        Here are your current observations: Action: go to sinkbasin 2
You arrive at sinkbasin 2. On the sinkbasin 2, you see nothing.

Action: clean cloth 1 with sinkbasin 2
You clean the cloth 1 using the sinkbasin 2.


        Only the following actions are allowed: (There are only two types: object and receptacle)
        1. go to a receptacle
            :action GotoLocation
            :parameters (?from - receptacle ?to - receptacle)
        2. open a receptacle if it is closed
            :action OpenObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        3. close a receptacle
            :action CloseObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        4. take an object from another receptacle
            :action PickupObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        5. put object into/on/in another receptacle
            :action PutObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        6. using an object/receptacle by turning it on/off with a switch
            :action useObject
            :parameters (?o - object)
        7. heat an object using a receptacle
            :action HeatObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - microwaveReceptacle)
        8. clean an object using a receptacle
            :action CleanObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - sinkbasinReceptacle)
        9. cool an object using a receptacle
            :action CoolObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - fridgeReceptacle)
        10. slice an object using a sharp object
            :action SliceObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle ?co - object ?sharp_o - sharpObject)

        You must go to a receptacle first in order to use/open it or take/put objects from/on it.

        The process involves two main stages:

        1. Always searching for the aim Object first!!!
            In this stage, your goal is to go to and may need to open new, unvisited recepatacles until you find the object mentioned in the task. Some receptacles cannot be opened so you can directly see what objects after you go to that receptacle.

            You can only use the GotoLocation action to travel to a new location and the OpenObject action (if the receptacle is closed) to verify whether it contains the target object.

            Goal 1.1: Reach a location that has not been visited (the location should be a receptacle) using the GotoLocation action. 
                You goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (at ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be somewhere or some recepatacles not visited.

            Goal 1.2: If you already go to the recepatacle and found the recepatacle is closed, use the OpenObject action to open it and inspect the contents. 
                Your goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (opened ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be the recepatacle you want to open.

        2. After you seeing the aim object in any receptacle, using the Object to Complete the Task:
            After you have located the object (the object may have some numbers added), you should always first pick up the object from that receptacle and update your goal to focus on how the object is used to complete the task. Remember your goal is Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.. Based on different adjectives, you may need to perform different actions for the object in different ways.

            This may involve more than simply transferring it from one place to another.
            For example: You might examine the object or a nearby receptacle to gather information. You may need to use another tool or device (like a lamp or a switch). Some tasks require you to slice, heat, cool, or clean the object using an appropriate receptacle (e.g., microwave, sink, fridge).

            If necessary, use the PickupObject action to retrieve the item, and the GotoLocation action to move to the correct place.
            Then, apply the object in a purposeful way — not just move it — but interact with the environment to fulfill the task’s actual goal.

            Hint: 
            1. If you want to heat, clean, and cool an object, after you go to that aim receptacle, do not put the object in the receptacle but do the action directly. For example, go to fridge, then cool the object with receptacle.
            2. If you want to slice an object, you should first go to the receptacle where both the sharp object and the aim object are located and ONLY pick up the sharp object then do the slice action. Don't forget to put the sharp object back to the receptacle after you finish slicing.
            3. If you want to examine or look at an object with a lamp, you should first go to the receptacle where the object is located and then pick it up and take the USE action of the lamp. You don't need to take the lamp but directly use it.
            4. If there are multiple actions needed to complete the task, you can break them down into smaller subgoals. For example, if you need to slice and then heat an object, first focus on slicing it, and then move on to heating it.

        In summary, the first stage is all about finding the object—this might involve going to an unvisited receptacle and opening it if necessary.
        
        Note: 
        1. some receptacles have numbers in their names. Always keep them as they are. For example, "towelholder1" should not be changed to "towelholder".
        2. Your initial goal should always be to go to a new location instead of put something into somewhere.
        3. Do not enter stage 2 when not finishing stage 1.

        Note: Always include :negative-preconditions in your :requirements whenever you use (not …) or delete effects, and never leave an :precondition or :effect block empty—either omit it or include at least one literal.

        You are in an environment that you must explore step by step. Your task is to build and update PDDL files for the environment using only your direct observations. Do not create or assume any objects, relationships, or details that have not been observed, and ensure you include all observations.

        The environment is a room containing various objects. Some of these objects are on, in, or contained within other objects and receptacles. You will initially be located as init_receptacle. You can assume all receptacles are freely reachable.
        
        Now, Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.
        Here are your current observations: Action: go to toilet 1
You arrive at toilet 1. On the toilet 1, you see nothing.


        Only the following actions are allowed: (There are only two types: object and receptacle)
        1. go to a receptacle
            :action GotoLocation
            :parameters (?from - receptacle ?to - receptacle)
        2. open a receptacle if it is closed
            :action OpenObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        3. close a receptacle
            :action CloseObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        4. take an object from another receptacle
            :action PickupObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        5. put object into/on/in another receptacle
            :action PutObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        6. using an object/receptacle by turning it on/off with a switch
            :action useObject
            :parameters (?o - object)
        7. heat an object using a receptacle
            :action HeatObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - microwaveReceptacle)
        8. clean an object using a receptacle
            :action CleanObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - sinkbasinReceptacle)
        9. cool an object using a receptacle
            :action CoolObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - fridgeReceptacle)
        10. slice an object using a sharp object
            :action SliceObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle ?co - object ?sharp_o - sharpObject)

        You must go to a receptacle first in order to use/open it or take/put objects from/on it.

        The process involves two main stages:

        1. Always searching for the aim Object first!!!
            In this stage, your goal is to go to and may need to open new, unvisited recepatacles until you find the object mentioned in the task. Some receptacles cannot be opened so you can directly see what objects after you go to that receptacle.

            You can only use the GotoLocation action to travel to a new location and the OpenObject action (if the receptacle is closed) to verify whether it contains the target object.

            Goal 1.1: Reach a location that has not been visited (the location should be a receptacle) using the GotoLocation action. 
                You goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (at ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be somewhere or some recepatacles not visited.

            Goal 1.2: If you already go to the recepatacle and found the recepatacle is closed, use the OpenObject action to open it and inspect the contents. 
                Your goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (opened ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be the recepatacle you want to open.

        2. After you seeing the aim object in any receptacle, using the Object to Complete the Task:
            After you have located the object (the object may have some numbers added), you should always first pick up the object from that receptacle and update your goal to focus on how the object is used to complete the task. Remember your goal is Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.. Based on different adjectives, you may need to perform different actions for the object in different ways.

            This may involve more than simply transferring it from one place to another.
            For example: You might examine the object or a nearby receptacle to gather information. You may need to use another tool or device (like a lamp or a switch). Some tasks require you to slice, heat, cool, or clean the object using an appropriate receptacle (e.g., microwave, sink, fridge).

            If necessary, use the PickupObject action to retrieve the item, and the GotoLocation action to move to the correct place.
            Then, apply the object in a purposeful way — not just move it — but interact with the environment to fulfill the task’s actual goal.

            Hint: 
            1. If you want to heat, clean, and cool an object, after you go to that aim receptacle, do not put the object in the receptacle but do the action directly. For example, go to fridge, then cool the object with receptacle.
            2. If you want to slice an object, you should first go to the receptacle where both the sharp object and the aim object are located and ONLY pick up the sharp object then do the slice action. Don't forget to put the sharp object back to the receptacle after you finish slicing.
            3. If you want to examine or look at an object with a lamp, you should first go to the receptacle where the object is located and then pick it up and take the USE action of the lamp. You don't need to take the lamp but directly use it.
            4. If there are multiple actions needed to complete the task, you can break them down into smaller subgoals. For example, if you need to slice and then heat an object, first focus on slicing it, and then move on to heating it.

        In summary, the first stage is all about finding the object—this might involve going to an unvisited receptacle and opening it if necessary.
        
        Note: 
        1. some receptacles have numbers in their names. Always keep them as they are. For example, "towelholder1" should not be changed to "towelholder".
        2. Your initial goal should always be to go to a new location instead of put something into somewhere.
        3. Do not enter stage 2 when not finishing stage 1.

        Note: Always include :negative-preconditions in your :requirements whenever you use (not …) or delete effects, and never leave an :precondition or :effect block empty—either omit it or include at least one literal.

        Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
        The format should strictly be:

            "pf": "..."
            }
    
        You are in an environment that you must explore step by step. Your task is to build and update PDDL files for the environment using only your direct observations. Do not create or assume any objects, relationships, or details that have not been observed, and ensure you include all observations.

        The environment is a room containing various objects. Some of these objects are on, in, or contained within other objects and receptacles. You will initially be located as init_receptacle. You can assume all receptacles are freely reachable.
        
        Now, Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.
        Here are your current observations: Action: go to toilet 1
You arrive at toilet 1. On the toilet 1, you see nothing.


        Only the following actions are allowed: (There are only two types: object and receptacle)
        1. go to a receptacle
            :action GotoLocation
            :parameters (?from - receptacle ?to - receptacle)
        2. open a receptacle if it is closed
            :action OpenObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        3. close a receptacle
            :action CloseObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        4. take an object from another receptacle
            :action PickupObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        5. put object into/on/in another receptacle
            :action PutObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        6. using an object/receptacle by turning it on/off with a switch
            :action useObject
            :parameters (?o - object)
        7. heat an object using a receptacle
            :action HeatObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - microwaveReceptacle)
        8. clean an object using a receptacle
            :action CleanObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - sinkbasinReceptacle)
        9. cool an object using a receptacle
            :action CoolObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - fridgeReceptacle)
        10. slice an object using a sharp object
            :action SliceObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle ?co - object ?sharp_o - sharpObject)

        You must go to a receptacle first in order to use/open it or take/put objects from/on it.

        The process involves two main stages:

        1. Always searching for the aim Object first!!!
            In this stage, your goal is to go to and may need to open new, unvisited recepatacles until you find the object mentioned in the task. Some receptacles cannot be opened so you can directly see what objects after you go to that receptacle.

            You can only use the GotoLocation action to travel to a new location and the OpenObject action (if the receptacle is closed) to verify whether it contains the target object.

            Goal 1.1: Reach a location that has not been visited (the location should be a receptacle) using the GotoLocation action. 
                You goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (at ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be somewhere or some recepatacles not visited.

            Goal 1.2: If you already go to the recepatacle and found the recepatacle is closed, use the OpenObject action to open it and inspect the contents. 
                Your goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (opened ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be the recepatacle you want to open.

        2. After you seeing the aim object in any receptacle, using the Object to Complete the Task:
            After you have located the object (the object may have some numbers added), you should always first pick up the object from that receptacle and update your goal to focus on how the object is used to complete the task. Remember your goal is Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.. Based on different adjectives, you may need to perform different actions for the object in different ways.

            This may involve more than simply transferring it from one place to another.
            For example: You might examine the object or a nearby receptacle to gather information. You may need to use another tool or device (like a lamp or a switch). Some tasks require you to slice, heat, cool, or clean the object using an appropriate receptacle (e.g., microwave, sink, fridge).

            If necessary, use the PickupObject action to retrieve the item, and the GotoLocation action to move to the correct place.
            Then, apply the object in a purposeful way — not just move it — but interact with the environment to fulfill the task’s actual goal.

            Hint: 
            1. If you want to heat, clean, and cool an object, after you go to that aim receptacle, do not put the object in the receptacle but do the action directly. For example, go to fridge, then cool the object with receptacle.
            2. If you want to slice an object, you should first go to the receptacle where both the sharp object and the aim object are located and ONLY pick up the sharp object then do the slice action. Don't forget to put the sharp object back to the receptacle after you finish slicing.
            3. If you want to examine or look at an object with a lamp, you should first go to the receptacle where the object is located and then pick it up and take the USE action of the lamp. You don't need to take the lamp but directly use it.
            4. If there are multiple actions needed to complete the task, you can break them down into smaller subgoals. For example, if you need to slice and then heat an object, first focus on slicing it, and then move on to heating it.

        In summary, the first stage is all about finding the object—this might involve going to an unvisited receptacle and opening it if necessary.
        
        Note: 
        1. some receptacles have numbers in their names. Always keep them as they are. For example, "towelholder1" should not be changed to "towelholder".
        2. Your initial goal should always be to go to a new location instead of put something into somewhere.
        3. Do not enter stage 2 when not finishing stage 1.

        Note: Always include :negative-preconditions in your :requirements whenever you use (not …) or delete effects, and never leave an :precondition or :effect block empty—either omit it or include at least one literal.

            :parameters (?r - receptacle ?co - object ?sharp_o - sharpObject)

        You must go to a receptacle first in order to use/open it or take/put objects from/on it.

        The process involves two main stages:

        1. Always searching for the aim Object first!!!
            In this stage, your goal is to go to and may need to open new, unvisited recepatacles until you find the object mentioned in the task. Some receptacles cannot be opened so you can directly see what objects after you go to that receptacle.

            You can only use the GotoLocation action to travel to a new location and the OpenObject action (if the receptacle is closed) to verify whether it contains the target object.

            Goal 1.1: Reach a location that has not been visited (the location should be a receptacle) using the GotoLocation action. 
                You goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (at ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be somewhere or some recepatacles not visited.

            Goal 1.2: If you already go to the recepatacle and found the recepatacle is closed, use the OpenObject action to open it and inspect the contents. 
                Your goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (opened ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be the recepatacle you want to open.

        2. After you seeing the aim object in any receptacle, using the Object to Complete the Task:
            After you have located the object (the object may have some numbers added), you should always first pick up the object from that receptacle and update your goal to focus on how the object is used to complete the task. Remember your goal is Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.. Based on different adjectives, you may need to perform different actions for the object in different ways.

            This may involve more than simply transferring it from one place to another.
            For example: You might examine the object or a nearby receptacle to gather information. You may need to use another tool or device (like a lamp or a switch). Some tasks require you to slice, heat, cool, or clean the object using an appropriate receptacle (e.g., microwave, sink, fridge).

            If necessary, use the PickupObject action to retrieve the item, and the GotoLocation action to move to the correct place.
            Then, apply the object in a purposeful way — not just move it — but interact with the environment to fulfill the task’s actual goal.

            Hint: 
            1. If you want to heat, clean, and cool an object, after you go to that aim receptacle, do not put the object in the receptacle but do the action directly. For example, go to fridge, then cool the object with receptacle.
            2. If you want to slice an object, you should first go to the receptacle where both the sharp object and the aim object are located and ONLY pick up the sharp object then do the slice action. Don't forget to put the sharp object back to the receptacle after you finish slicing.
            3. If you want to examine or look at an object with a lamp, you should first go to the receptacle where the object is located and then pick it up and take the USE action of the lamp. You don't need to take the lamp but directly use it.
            4. If there are multiple actions needed to complete the task, you can break them down into smaller subgoals. For example, if you need to slice and then heat an object, first focus on slicing it, and then move on to heating it.

        In summary, the first stage is all about finding the object—this might involve going to an unvisited receptacle and opening it if necessary.
        
        Note: 
        1. some receptacles have numbers in their names. Always keep them as they are. For example, "towelholder1" should not be changed to "towelholder".
        2. Your initial goal should always be to go to a new location instead of put something into somewhere.
        3. Do not enter stage 2 when not finishing stage 1.

        Note: Always include :negative-preconditions in your :requirements whenever you use (not …) or delete effects, and never leave an :precondition or :effect block empty—either omit it or include at least one literal.

        You must go to a receptacle first in order to use/open it or take/put objects from/on it.

        The process involves two main stages:

        1. Always searching for the aim Object first!!!

        2. After you seeing the aim object in any receptacle, using the Object to Complete the Task:
            After you have located the object (the object may have some numbers added), you should always first pick up the object from that receptacle and update your goal to focus on how the object is used to complete the task. Remember your goal is Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.. Based on different adjectives, you may need to perform different actions for the object in different ways.

            This may involve more than simply transferring it from one place to another.
            For example: You might examine the object or a nearby receptacle to gather information. You may need to use another tool or device (like a lamp or a switch). Some tasks require you to slice, heat, cool, or clean the object using an appropriate receptacle (e.g., microwave, sink, fridge).

            3. If you want to examine or look at an object with a lamp, you should first go to the receptacle where the object is located and then pick it up and take the USE action of the lamp. You don't need to take the lamp but directly use it.
            4. If there are multiple actions needed to complete the task, you can break them down into smaller subgoals. For example, if you need to slice and then heat an object, first focus on slicing it, and then move on to heating it.

        In summary, the first stage is all about finding the object—this might involve going to an unvisited receptacle and opening it if necessary.
        
        Note: 
        1. some receptacles have numbers in their names. Always keep them as they are. For example, "towelholder1" should not be changed to "towelholder".
        2. Your initial goal should always be to go to a new location instead of put something into somewhere.
        3. Do not enter stage 2 when not finishing stage 1.

        Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
        The format should strictly be:

        You are in an environment that you must explore step by step. Your task is to build and update PDDL files for the environment using only your direct observations. Do not create or assume any objects, relationships, or details that have not been observed, and ensure you include all observations.

        The environment is a room containing various objects. Some of these objects are on, in, or contained within other objects and receptacles. You will initially be located as init_receptacle. You can assume all receptacles are freely reachable.
        
        Now, Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.
        Here are your current observations: Action: go to toilet 1
You arrive at toilet 1. On the toilet 1, you see nothing.


        Only the following actions are allowed: (There are only two types: object and receptacle)
        1. go to a receptacle
            :action GotoLocation
            :parameters (?from - receptacle ?to - receptacle)
        2. open a receptacle if it is closed
            :action OpenObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        3. close a receptacle
            :action CloseObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        4. take an object from another receptacle
            :action PickupObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        5. put object into/on/in another receptacle
            :action PutObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        6. using an object/receptacle by turning it on/off with a switch
            :action useObject
            :parameters (?o - object)
        7. heat an object using a receptacle
            :action HeatObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - microwaveReceptacle)
        8. clean an object using a receptacle
            :action CleanObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - sinkbasinReceptacle)
        9. cool an object using a receptacle
            :action CoolObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - fridgeReceptacle)
        10. slice an object using a sharp object
            :action SliceObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle ?co - object ?sharp_o - sharpObject)

        You must go to a receptacle first in order to use/open it or take/put objects from/on it.

        The process involves two main stages:

        1. Always searching for the aim Object first!!!
            In this stage, your goal is to go to and may need to open new, unvisited recepatacles until you find the object mentioned in the task. Some receptacles cannot be opened so you can directly see what objects after you go to that receptacle.

            You can only use the GotoLocation action to travel to a new location and the OpenObject action (if the receptacle is closed) to verify whether it contains the target object.

            Goal 1.1: Reach a location that has not been visited (the location should be a receptacle) using the GotoLocation action. 
                You goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (at ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be somewhere or some recepatacles not visited.

            Goal 1.2: If you already go to the recepatacle and found the recepatacle is closed, use the OpenObject action to open it and inspect the contents. 
                Your goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (opened ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be the recepatacle you want to open.

        2. After you seeing the aim object in any receptacle, using the Object to Complete the Task:
            After you have located the object (the object may have some numbers added), you should always first pick up the object from that receptacle and update your goal to focus on how the object is used to complete the task. Remember your goal is Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.. Based on different adjectives, you may need to perform different actions for the object in different ways.

            This may involve more than simply transferring it from one place to another.
            For example: You might examine the object or a nearby receptacle to gather information. You may need to use another tool or device (like a lamp or a switch). Some tasks require you to slice, heat, cool, or clean the object using an appropriate receptacle (e.g., microwave, sink, fridge).

            If necessary, use the PickupObject action to retrieve the item, and the GotoLocation action to move to the correct place.
            Then, apply the object in a purposeful way — not just move it — but interact with the environment to fulfill the task’s actual goal.

            Hint: 
            1. If you want to heat, clean, and cool an object, after you go to that aim receptacle, do not put the object in the receptacle but do the action directly. For example, go to fridge, then cool the object with receptacle.
            2. If you want to slice an object, you should first go to the receptacle where both the sharp object and the aim object are located and ONLY pick up the sharp object then do the slice action. Don't forget to put the sharp object back to the receptacle after you finish slicing.
            3. If you want to examine or look at an object with a lamp, you should first go to the receptacle where the object is located and then pick it up and take the USE action of the lamp. You don't need to take the lamp but directly use it.
            4. If there are multiple actions needed to complete the task, you can break them down into smaller subgoals. For example, if you need to slice and then heat an object, first focus on slicing it, and then move on to heating it.

        In summary, the first stage is all about finding the object—this might involve going to an unvisited receptacle and opening it if necessary.
        
        Note: 
        1. some receptacles have numbers in their names. Always keep them as they are. For example, "towelholder1" should not be changed to "towelholder".
        2. Your initial goal should always be to go to a new location instead of put something into somewhere.
        3. Do not enter stage 2 when not finishing stage 1.

        Note: Always include :negative-preconditions in your :requirements whenever you use (not …) or delete effects, and never leave an :precondition or :effect block empty—either omit it or include at least one literal.

        You are in an environment that you must explore step by step. Your task is to build and update PDDL files for the environment using only your direct observations. Do not create or assume any objects, relationships, or details that have not been observed, and ensure you include all observations.

        The environment is a room containing various objects. Some of these objects are on, in, or contained within other objects and receptacles. You will initially be located as init_receptacle. You can assume all receptacles are freely reachable.
        
        Now, Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.
        Here are your current observations: Action: go to toilet 1
You arrive at toilet 1. On the toilet 1, you see nothing.


        Only the following actions are allowed: (There are only two types: object and receptacle)
        1. go to a receptacle
            :action GotoLocation
            :parameters (?from - receptacle ?to - receptacle)
        2. open a receptacle if it is closed
            :action OpenObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        3. close a receptacle
            :action CloseObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        4. take an object from another receptacle
            :action PickupObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        5. put object into/on/in another receptacle
            :action PutObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        6. using an object/receptacle by turning it on/off with a switch
            :action useObject
            :parameters (?o - object)
        7. heat an object using a receptacle
            :action HeatObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - microwaveReceptacle)
        8. clean an object using a receptacle
            :action CleanObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - sinkbasinReceptacle)
        9. cool an object using a receptacle
            :action CoolObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - fridgeReceptacle)
        10. slice an object using a sharp object
            :action SliceObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle ?co - object ?sharp_o - sharpObject)

        You must go to a receptacle first in order to use/open it or take/put objects from/on it.

        The process involves two main stages:

        1. Always searching for the aim Object first!!!
            In this stage, your goal is to go to and may need to open new, unvisited recepatacles until you find the object mentioned in the task. Some receptacles cannot be opened so you can directly see what objects after you go to that receptacle.

            You can only use the GotoLocation action to travel to a new location and the OpenObject action (if the receptacle is closed) to verify whether it contains the target object.

            Goal 1.1: Reach a location that has not been visited (the location should be a receptacle) using the GotoLocation action. 
                You goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (at ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be somewhere or some recepatacles not visited.

            Goal 1.2: If you already go to the recepatacle and found the recepatacle is closed, use the OpenObject action to open it and inspect the contents. 
                Your goal should look like this:
                (:goal 
                    (opened ?recepatacle)
                ) where recepatacle should be the recepatacle you want to open.

        2. After you seeing the aim object in any receptacle, using the Object to Complete the Task:
            After you have located the object (the object may have some numbers added), you should always first pick up the object from that receptacle and update your goal to focus on how the object is used to complete the task. Remember your goal is Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.. Based on different adjectives, you may need to perform different actions for the object in different ways.

            This may involve more than simply transferring it from one place to another.
            For example: You might examine the object or a nearby receptacle to gather information. You may need to use another tool or device (like a lamp or a switch). Some tasks require you to slice, heat, cool, or clean the object using an appropriate receptacle (e.g., microwave, sink, fridge).

            If necessary, use the PickupObject action to retrieve the item, and the GotoLocation action to move to the correct place.
            Then, apply the object in a purposeful way — not just move it — but interact with the environment to fulfill the task’s actual goal.

            Hint: 
            1. If you want to heat, clean, and cool an object, after you go to that aim receptacle, do not put the object in the receptacle but do the action directly. For example, go to fridge, then cool the object with receptacle.
            2. If you want to slice an object, you should first go to the receptacle where both the sharp object and the aim object are located and ONLY pick up the sharp object then do the slice action. Don't forget to put the sharp object back to the receptacle after you finish slicing.
            3. If you want to examine or look at an object with a lamp, you should first go to the receptacle where the object is located and then pick it up and take the USE action of the lamp. You don't need to take the lamp but directly use it.
            4. If there are multiple actions needed to complete the task, you can break them down into smaller subgoals. For example, if you need to slice and then heat an object, first focus on slicing it, and then move on to heating it.

        In summary, the first stage is all about finding the object—this might involve going to an unvisited receptacle and opening it if necessary.
        
        Note: 
        1. some receptacles have numbers in their names. Always keep them as they are. For example, "towelholder1" should not be changed to "towelholder".
        2. Your initial goal should always be to go to a new location instead of put something into somewhere.
        3. Do not enter stage 2 when not finishing stage 1.

        Note: Always include :negative-preconditions in your :requirements whenever you use (not …) or delete effects, and never leave an :precondition or :effect block empty—either omit it or include at least one literal.
