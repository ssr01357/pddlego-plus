Do not create or assume any objects, relationships, or details that have not been observed, and ensure you include all observations.

        The environment is a room containing various objects. Some of these objects are on, in, or contained within other objects and receptacles. You will initially be located as init_receptacle. You can assume all receptacles are freely reachable.
        
        Now, Your task is to: put a cool apple in microwave.
        Here are your current observations: Action: look around
You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you see a cabinet 20, a cabinet 19, a cabinet 18, a cabinet 17, a cabinet 16, a cabinet 15, a cabinet 14, a cabinet 13, a cabinet 12, a cabinet 11, a cabinet 10, a cabinet 9, a cabinet 8, a cabinet 7, a cabinet 6, a cabinet 5, a cabinet 4, a cabinet 3, a cabinet 2, a cabinet 1, a coffeemachine 1, a countertop 3, a countertop 2, a countertop 1, a drawer 3, a drawer 2, a drawer 1, a fridge 1, a garbagecan 1, a microwave 1, a shelf 3, a shelf 2, a shelf 1, a sinkbasin 1, a stoveburner 4, a stoveburner 3, a stoveburner 2, a stoveburner 1, and a toaster 1.


        The following actions are allowed: (There are only two types: object and receptacle)
        1. go to a receptacle
            :action GotoLocation
            :parameters (?from - receptacle ?to - receptacle)
        2. open a receptacle if it is closed
            :action OpenObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        3. close a receptacle
            :action CloseObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        4. take an object from another receptacle
            :action PickupObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        5. put object into/on/in another receptacle
            :action PutObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        6. using an object/receptacle by turning it on/off with a switch
            :action useObject
            :parameters (?o - object)
        7. heat an object using a receptacle
            :action HeatObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - microwaveReceptacle)
        8. clean an object using a receptacle
            :action CleanObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        9. cool an object using a receptacle
            :action CoolObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - fridgeReceptacle)
        10. slice an object using a sharp object
            :action SliceObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle ?co - object ?sharp_o - object)

        Your process involves two main stages with the following subgoals:

        Stage 1: Search for the Target Object
            Goal 1.1: Move to a new, unvisited receptacle using the GotoLocation action.
            Goal 1.2: If the receptacle is closed, use the OpenObject action to reveal its contents.

        Stage 2: Use the Object to Complete the Task
            Goal 2.1: Pick up the target object using the PickupObject action.
            Goal 2.2: Move to the appropriate location needed to fulfill the task.
            Goal 2.3: Interact with relevant objects or receptacles (e.g., heat, clean, cool, slice, or use) to accomplish the task.

        Constraints:
            1. Do not assume unseen objects or relationships.
            2. Receptacle names must be preserved exactly.
            3. Do not proceed to Stage 2 before completing Stage 1.
        
        Note: Always include :negative-preconditions in your :requirements whenever you use (not …) or delete effects, and never leave an :precondition or :effect block empty—either omit it or include at least one literal.

        Here are your current observations: Action: look around
You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you see a cabinet 20, a cabinet 19, a cabinet 18, a cabinet 17, a cabinet 16, a cabinet 15, a cabinet 14, a cabinet 13, a cabinet 12, a cabinet 11, a cabinet 10, a cabinet 9, a cabinet 8, a cabinet 7, a cabinet 6, a cabinet 5, a cabinet 4, a cabinet 3, a cabinet 2, a cabinet 1, a coffeemachine 1, a countertop 3, a countertop 2, a countertop 1, a drawer 3, a drawer 2, a drawer 1, a fridge 1, a garbagecan 1, a microwave 1, a shelf 3, a shelf 2, a shelf 1, a sinkbasin 1, a stoveburner 4, a stoveburner 3, a stoveburner 2, a stoveburner 1, and a toaster 1.


        The following actions are allowed: (There are only two types: object and receptacle)
        1. go to a receptacle
            :action GotoLocation
            :parameters (?from - receptacle ?to - receptacle)
        2. open a receptacle if it is closed
            :action OpenObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        3. close a receptacle
            :action CloseObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        4. take an object from another receptacle
            :action PickupObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        5. put object into/on/in another receptacle
            :action PutObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        6. using an object/receptacle by turning it on/off with a switch
            :action useObject
            :parameters (?o - object)
        7. heat an object using a receptacle
            :action HeatObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - microwaveReceptacle)
        8. clean an object using a receptacle
            :action CleanObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        9. cool an object using a receptacle
            :action CoolObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - fridgeReceptacle)
        10. slice an object using a sharp object
            :action SliceObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle ?co - object ?sharp_o - object)

        Your process involves two main stages with the following subgoals:

        Stage 1: Search for the Target Object
            Goal 1.1: Move to a new, unvisited receptacle using the GotoLocation action.
            Goal 1.2: If the receptacle is closed, use the OpenObject action to reveal its contents.

        Stage 2: Use the Object to Complete the Task
            Goal 2.1: Pick up the target object using the PickupObject action.
            Goal 2.2: Move to the appropriate location needed to fulfill the task.
            Goal 2.3: Interact with relevant objects or receptacles (e.g., heat, clean, cool, slice, or use) to accomplish the task.

        Constraints:
            1. Do not assume unseen objects or relationships.
            2. Receptacle names must be preserved exactly.
            3. Do not proceed to Stage 2 before completing Stage 1.
        
        Note: Always include :negative-preconditions in your :requirements whenever you use (not …) or delete effects, and never leave an :precondition or :effect block empty—either omit it or include at least one literal.

        You are in an environment that you must explore step by step. Your task is to build and update PDDL files for the environment using only your direct observations. Do not create or assume any objects, relationships, or details that have not been observed, and ensure you include all observations.

        The environment is a room containing various objects. Some of these objects are on, in, or contained within other objects and receptacles. You will initially be located as init_receptacle. You can assume all receptacles are freely reachable.
        
        Now, Your task is to: put a cool apple in microwave.
        Here are your current observations: Action: look around
You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you see a cabinet 20, a cabinet 19, a cabinet 18, a cabinet 17, a cabinet 16, a cabinet 15, a cabinet 14, a cabinet 13, a cabinet 12, a cabinet 11, a cabinet 10, a cabinet 9, a cabinet 8, a cabinet 7, a cabinet 6, a cabinet 5, a cabinet 4, a cabinet 3, a cabinet 2, a cabinet 1, a coffeemachine 1, a countertop 3, a countertop 2, a countertop 1, a drawer 3, a drawer 2, a drawer 1, a fridge 1, a garbagecan 1, a microwave 1, a shelf 3, a shelf 2, a shelf 1, a sinkbasin 1, a stoveburner 4, a stoveburner 3, a stoveburner 2, a stoveburner 1, and a toaster 1.


        The following actions are allowed: (There are only two types: object and receptacle)
        1. go to a receptacle
            :action GotoLocation
            :parameters (?from - receptacle ?to - receptacle)
        2. open a receptacle if it is closed
            :action OpenObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        3. close a receptacle
            :action CloseObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        4. take an object from another receptacle
            :action PickupObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        5. put object into/on/in another receptacle
            :action PutObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        6. using an object/receptacle by turning it on/off with a switch
            :action useObject
            :parameters (?o - object)
        7. heat an object using a receptacle
            :action HeatObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - microwaveReceptacle)
        8. clean an object using a receptacle
            :action CleanObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        9. cool an object using a receptacle
            :action CoolObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - fridgeReceptacle)
        10. slice an object using a sharp object
            :action SliceObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle ?co - object ?sharp_o - object)

        Your process involves two main stages with the following subgoals:

        Stage 1: Search for the Target Object
            Goal 1.1: Move to a new, unvisited receptacle using the GotoLocation action.
            Goal 1.2: If the receptacle is closed, use the OpenObject action to reveal its contents.

        Stage 2: Use the Object to Complete the Task
            Goal 2.1: Pick up the target object using the PickupObject action.
            Goal 2.2: Move to the appropriate location needed to fulfill the task.
            Goal 2.3: Interact with relevant objects or receptacles (e.g., heat, clean, cool, slice, or use) to accomplish the task.

        Constraints:
            1. Do not assume unseen objects or relationships.
            2. Receptacle names must be preserved exactly.
            3. Do not proceed to Stage 2 before completing Stage 1.
        
        Note: Always include :negative-preconditions in your :requirements whenever you use (not …) or delete effects, and never leave an :precondition or :effect block empty—either omit it or include at least one literal.
