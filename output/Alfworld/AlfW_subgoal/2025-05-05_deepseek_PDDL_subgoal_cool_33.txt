        The environment is a room containing various objects. Some of these objects are on, in, or contained within other objects and receptacles. You will initially be located as init_receptacle. You can assume all receptacles are freely reachable.
        
        Now, Your task is to: cool some mug and put it in coffeemachine.
        Here are your current observations: Action: look around
You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you see a cabinet 27, a cabinet 26, a cabinet 25, a cabinet 24, a cabinet 23, a cabinet 22, a cabinet 21, a cabinet 20, a cabinet 19, a cabinet 18, a cabinet 17, a cabinet 16, a cabinet 15, a cabinet 14, a cabinet 13, a cabinet 12, a cabinet 11, a cabinet 10, a cabinet 9, a cabinet 8, a cabinet 7, a cabinet 6, a cabinet 5, a cabinet 4, a cabinet 3, a cabinet 2, a cabinet 1, a coffeemachine 1, a countertop 2, a countertop 1, a diningtable 1, a drawer 12, a drawer 11, a drawer 10, a drawer 9, a drawer 8, a drawer 7, a drawer 6, a drawer 5, a drawer 4, a drawer 3, a drawer 2, a drawer 1, a fridge 1, a garbagecan 1, a microwave 1, a sinkbasin 1, a stoveburner 4, a stoveburner 3, a stoveburner 2, a stoveburner 1, and a toaster 1.


        The following actions are allowed: (There are only two types: object and receptacle)
        1. go to a receptacle
            :action GotoLocation
            :parameters (?from - receptacle ?to - receptacle)
        2. open a receptacle if it is closed
            :action OpenObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        3. close a receptacle
            :action CloseObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        4. take an object from another receptacle
            :action PickupObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        5. put object into/on/in another receptacle
            :action PutObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        6. using an object/receptacle by turning it on/off with a switch
            :action useObject
            :parameters (?o - object)
        7. heat an object using a receptacle
            :action HeatObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - microwaveReceptacle)
        8. clean an object using a receptacle
            :action CleanObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        9. cool an object using a receptacle
            :action CoolObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - fridgeReceptacle)

            :action SliceObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle ?co - object ?sharp_o - object)

        Your process involves two main stages with the following subgoals:

        Stage 1: Search for the Target Object
            Goal 1.1: Move to a new, unvisited receptacle using the GotoLocation action.
            Goal 1.2: If the receptacle is closed, use the OpenObject action to reveal its contents.

        Stage 2: Use the Object to Complete the Task
            Goal 2.1: Pick up the target object using the PickupObject action.
            Goal 2.2: Move to the appropriate location needed to fulfill the task.
            Goal 2.3: Interact with relevant objects or receptacles (e.g., heat, clean, cool, slice, or use) to accomplish the task.

        Constraints:
            1. Do not assume unseen objects or relationships.
            2. Receptacle names must be preserved exactly.
            3. Do not proceed to Stage 2 before completing Stage 1.
        
        Note: Always include :negative-preconditions in your :requirements whenever you use (not …) or delete effects, and never leave an :precondition or :effect block empty—either omit it or include at least one literal.

Looking quickly around you, you see a cabinet 27, a cabinet 26, a cabinet 25, a cabinet 24, a cabinet 23, a cabinet 22, a cabinet 21, a cabinet 20, a cabinet 19, a cabinet 18, a cabinet 17, a cabinet 16, a cabinet 15, a cabinet 14, a cabinet 13, a cabinet 12, a cabinet 11, a cabinet 10, a cabinet 9, a cabinet 8, a cabinet 7, a cabinet 6, a cabinet 5, a cabinet 4, a cabinet 3, a cabinet 2, a cabinet 1, a coffeemachine 1, a countertop 2, a countertop 1, a diningtable 1, a drawer 12, a drawer 11, a drawer 10, a drawer 9, a drawer 8, a drawer 7, a drawer 6, a drawer 5, a drawer 4, a drawer 3, a drawer 2, a drawer 1, a fridge 1, a garbagecan 1, a microwave 1, a sinkbasin 1, a stoveburner 4, a stoveburner 3, a stoveburner 2, a stoveburner 1, and a toaster 1.


        The following actions are allowed: (There are only two types: object and receptacle)
        1. go to a receptacle
            :action GotoLocation
            :parameters (?from - receptacle ?to - receptacle)
        2. open a receptacle if it is closed
            :action OpenObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        3. close a receptacle
            :action CloseObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        4. take an object from another receptacle
            :action PickupObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        5. put object into/on/in another receptacle
            :action PutObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        6. using an object/receptacle by turning it on/off with a switch
            :action useObject
            :parameters (?o - object)
        7. heat an object using a receptacle
            :action HeatObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - microwaveReceptacle)
        8. clean an object using a receptacle
            :action CleanObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        9. cool an object using a receptacle
            :action CoolObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - fridgeReceptacle)
        10. slice an object using a sharp object
            :action SliceObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle ?co - object ?sharp_o - object)

        Your process involves two main stages with the following subgoals:

        Stage 1: Search for the Target Object
            Goal 1.1: Move to a new, unvisited receptacle using the GotoLocation action.
            Goal 1.2: If the receptacle is closed, use the OpenObject action to reveal its contents.

        Stage 2: Use the Object to Complete the Task
            Goal 2.1: Pick up the target object using the PickupObject action.
            Goal 2.2: Move to the appropriate location needed to fulfill the task.
            Goal 2.3: Interact with relevant objects or receptacles (e.g., heat, clean, cool, slice, or use) to accomplish the task.

        Constraints:
            1. Do not assume unseen objects or relationships.
            2. Receptacle names must be preserved exactly.
            3. Do not proceed to Stage 2 before completing Stage 1.
        
        Note: Always include :negative-preconditions in your :requirements whenever you use (not …) or delete effects, and never leave an :precondition or :effect block empty—either omit it or include at least one literal.

        Your process involves two main stages with the following subgoals:

        Stage 1: Search for the Target Object
            Goal 1.1: Move to a new, unvisited receptacle using the GotoLocation action.
            Goal 1.2: If the receptacle is closed, use the OpenObject action to reveal its contents.

        Stage 2: Use the Object to Complete the Task
            Goal 2.1: Pick up the target object using the PickupObject action.
            Goal 2.2: Move to the appropriate location needed to fulfill the task.
            Goal 2.3: Interact with relevant objects or receptacles (e.g., heat, clean, cool, slice, or use) to accomplish the task.

        Constraints:
            1. Do not assume unseen objects or relationships.
            2. Receptacle names must be preserved exactly.
            3. Do not proceed to Stage 2 before completing Stage 1.
        
        Note: Always include :negative-preconditions in your :requirements whenever you use (not …) or delete effects, and never leave an :precondition or :effect block empty—either omit it or include at least one literal.
