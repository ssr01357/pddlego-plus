Prompt: 
        You are in an environment that you explore step by step. Based on your observations, generate one valid action at a time to progress in the environment.
        Your task is to interact with objects and receptacles to complete a goal step by step.

        Your specific task goal: Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.

        Here are your current observations: Action: look around
You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you see a bathtubbasin 1, a cabinet 4, a cabinet 3, a cabinet 2, a cabinet 1, a countertop 1, a drawer 4, a drawer 3, a drawer 2, a drawer 1, a dresser 1, a garbagecan 1, a handtowelholder 1, a sinkbasin 2, a sinkbasin 1, a toilet 1, a toiletpaperhanger 1, and a towelholder 1.


        Valid actions you can take (follow exactly this format, replacing the parts in brackets with actual object and location names. Do not include any brackets in your output):
            - go to [towelholder 1]
            - open [cabinet 2]
            - take [cloth 1] from [cabinet 3]
            - move [soap bar 1] to [sink basin 2]
            - use [desk lamp 1]
            - heat [bread 1] with [microwave 1]
            - clean [fork 1] with [sink basin 1]
            - cool [wine bottle 1] with [fridge 1]
            - slice [bread 1] with [knife 1]
        Only replace the object and receptacle names (the words that were inside the brackets) with the actual values from the game environment. Do not change the structure. Do not include brackets.

        Your actions should exactly follow this phrasing — do not invent new formats. Every action must correspond to a valid command from the environment.

        You must go to a receptacle first in order to use/open it or take/put objects from/on it. You can assume all receptacles are freely reachable.

        The process involves two main stages:

        1. Always searching for the aim Object first!!!
            In this stage, your goal is to go to and may need to open new, unvisited recepatacles until you find the object mentioned in the task. Some receptacles cannot be opened so you can directly see what objects after you go to that receptacle.

            You can only use the GotoLocation action to travel to a new location and the OpenObject action (if the receptacle is closed) to verify whether it contains the target object.

        2. Using the Object to Complete the Task:
            Once you have located and picked up the object, update your goal to focus on how the object is used to complete the task. This may involve more than simply transferring it from one place to another.
            For example: You might examine the object or a nearby receptacle to gather information. You may need to use another tool or device (like a lamp or a switch). Some tasks require you to slice, heat, cool, or clean the object using an appropriate receptacle (e.g., microwave, sink, fridge).

            If necessary, use the PickupObject action to retrieve the item, and the GotoLocation action to move to the correct place.
            Then, apply the object in a purposeful way — not just move it — but interact with the environment to fulfill the task’s actual goal.

            Note: if you want to heat, clean, and cool an object, you can go to that receptacle then do the action directly without put the object into that receptacle.
                But if you want to slice an object, you should first go to the receptacle and pick up the sharp object then do the slice action.

        In summary, the first stage is all about finding the object—this might involve going to an unvisited receptacle and opening it if necessary.
        
        Note: 
        1. some receptacles have numbers in their names. Always keep them as they are. For example, "towelholder1" should not be changed to "towelholder".
        2. Your initial goal should always be to go to a new location instead of put something into somewhere.
        3. Do not enter stage 2 when not finishing stage 1.

        Memory of past steps:
        Action: look around
You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you see a bathtubbasin 1, a cabinet 4, a cabinet 3, a cabinet 2, a cabinet 1, a countertop 1, a drawer 4, a drawer 3, a drawer 2, a drawer 1, a dresser 1, a garbagecan 1, a handtowelholder 1, a sinkbasin 2, a sinkbasin 1, a toilet 1, a toiletpaperhanger 1, and a towelholder 1.

                But if you want to slice an object, you should first go to the receptacle and pick up the sharp object then do the slice action.

        In summary, the first stage is all about finding the object—this might involve going to an unvisited receptacle and opening it if necessary.
        
        Note: 
        1. some receptacles have numbers in their names. Always keep them as they are. For example, "towelholder1" should not be changed to "towelholder".
        2. Your initial goal should always be to go to a new location instead of put something into somewhere.

Prompt: 
        You are in an environment that you explore step by step. Based on your observations, generate one valid action at a time to progress in the environment.
        Your task is to interact with objects and receptacles to complete a goal step by step.

        Your specific task goal: Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.

        Here are your current observations: Action: go to cabinet 3
You arrive at cabinet 3. The cabinet 3 is closed.


        Valid actions you can take (follow exactly this format, replacing the parts in brackets with actual object and location names. Do not include any brackets in your output):
            - go to [towelholder 1]
            - open [cabinet 2]
            - take [cloth 1] from [cabinet 3]
            - move [soap bar 1] to [sink basin 2]
            - use [desk lamp 1]
            - heat [bread 1] with [microwave 1]
            - clean [fork 1] with [sink basin 1]
            - cool [wine bottle 1] with [fridge 1]
            - slice [bread 1] with [knife 1]
        Only replace the object and receptacle names (the words that were inside the brackets) with the actual values from the game environment. Do not change the structure. Do not include brackets.

        Your actions should exactly follow this phrasing — do not invent new formats. Every action must correspond to a valid command from the environment.

        You must go to a receptacle first in order to use/open it or take/put objects from/on it. You can assume all receptacles are freely reachable.

        The process involves two main stages:

        1. Always searching for the aim Object first!!!
            In this stage, your goal is to go to and may need to open new, unvisited recepatacles until you find the object mentioned in the task. Some receptacles cannot be opened so you can directly see what objects after you go to that receptacle.

            You can only use the GotoLocation action to travel to a new location and the OpenObject action (if the receptacle is closed) to verify whether it contains the target object.

        2. Using the Object to Complete the Task:
            Once you have located and picked up the object, update your goal to focus on how the object is used to complete the task. This may involve more than simply transferring it from one place to another.
            For example: You might examine the object or a nearby receptacle to gather information. You may need to use another tool or device (like a lamp or a switch). Some tasks require you to slice, heat, cool, or clean the object using an appropriate receptacle (e.g., microwave, sink, fridge).

            If necessary, use the PickupObject action to retrieve the item, and the GotoLocation action to move to the correct place.
            Then, apply the object in a purposeful way — not just move it — but interact with the environment to fulfill the task’s actual goal.

            Note: if you want to heat, clean, and cool an object, you can go to that receptacle then do the action directly without put the object into that receptacle.

Prompt: 
        You are in an environment that you explore step by step. Based on your observations, generate one valid action at a time to progress in the environment.
        Your task is to interact with objects and receptacles to complete a goal step by step.

        Your specific task goal: Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.

        Here are your current observations: Action: go to drawer 1
You arrive at drawer 1. On the drawer 1, you see nothing.


        Valid actions you can take (follow exactly this format, replacing the parts in brackets with actual object and location names. Do not include any brackets in your output):
            - go to [towelholder 1]
            - open [cabinet 2]
            - take [cloth 1] from [cabinet 3]
            - move [soap bar 1] to [sink basin 2]
            - use [desk lamp 1]
            - heat [bread 1] with [microwave 1]
            - clean [fork 1] with [sink basin 1]
            - cool [wine bottle 1] with [fridge 1]
            - slice [bread 1] with [knife 1]
        Only replace the object and receptacle names (the words that were inside the brackets) with the actual values from the game environment. Do not change the structure. Do not include brackets.

        Your actions should exactly follow this phrasing — do not invent new formats. Every action must correspond to a valid command from the environment.

        You must go to a receptacle first in order to use/open it or take/put objects from/on it. You can assume all receptacles are freely reachable.

        The process involves two main stages:

        1. Always searching for the aim Object first!!!
            In this stage, your goal is to go to and may need to open new, unvisited recepatacles until you find the object mentioned in the task. Some receptacles cannot be opened so you can directly see what objects after you go to that receptacle.

            You can only use the GotoLocation action to travel to a new location and the OpenObject action (if the receptacle is closed) to verify whether it contains the target object.

        2. Using the Object to Complete the Task:
            Once you have located and picked up the object, update your goal to focus on how the object is used to complete the task. This may involve more than simply transferring it from one place to another.
            For example: You might examine the object or a nearby receptacle to gather information. You may need to use another tool or device (like a lamp or a switch). Some tasks require you to slice, heat, cool, or clean the object using an appropriate receptacle (e.g., microwave, sink, fridge).

            If necessary, use the PickupObject action to retrieve the item, and the GotoLocation action to move to the correct place.
            Then, apply the object in a purposeful way — not just move it — but interact with the environment to fulfill the task’s actual goal.

            Note: if you want to heat, clean, and cool an object, you can go to that receptacle then do the action directly without put the object into that receptacle.
                But if you want to slice an object, you should first go to the receptacle and pick up the sharp object then do the slice action.

        In summary, the first stage is all about finding the object—this might involve going to an unvisited receptacle and opening it if necessary.
        
        Note: 
        1. some receptacles have numbers in their names. Always keep them as they are. For example, "towelholder1" should not be changed to "towelholder".
        2. Your initial goal should always be to go to a new location instead of put something into somewhere.
        3. Do not enter stage 2 when not finishing stage 1.

        Memory of past steps:

Looking quickly around you, you see a bathtubbasin 1, a cabinet 4, a cabinet 3, a cabinet 2, a cabinet 1, a countertop 1, a drawer 4, a drawer 3, a drawer 2, a drawer 1, a dresser 1, a garbagecan 1, a handtowelholder 1, a sinkbasin 2, a sinkbasin 1, a toilet 1, a toiletpaperhanger 1, and a towelholder 1.

Prompt: 
        You are in an environment that you explore step by step. Based on your observations, generate one valid action at a time to progress in the environment.
        Your task is to interact with objects and receptacles to complete a goal step by step.

        Your specific task goal: Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.

        Here are your current observations: Action: go to drawer 4
You arrive at drawer 4. On the drawer 4, you see a candle 2.


        Valid actions you can take (follow exactly this format, replacing the parts in brackets with actual object and location names. Do not include any brackets in your output):
            - go to [towelholder 1]
            - open [cabinet 2]
            - take [cloth 1] from [cabinet 3]
            - move [soap bar 1] to [sink basin 2]
            - use [desk lamp 1]
            - heat [bread 1] with [microwave 1]
            - clean [fork 1] with [sink basin 1]
            - cool [wine bottle 1] with [fridge 1]
            - slice [bread 1] with [knife 1]
        Only replace the object and receptacle names (the words that were inside the brackets) with the actual values from the game environment. Do not change the structure. Do not include brackets.

        Your actions should exactly follow this phrasing — do not invent new formats. Every action must correspond to a valid command from the environment.

        You must go to a receptacle first in order to use/open it or take/put objects from/on it. You can assume all receptacles are freely reachable.

        The process involves two main stages:

        1. Always searching for the aim Object first!!!
            In this stage, your goal is to go to and may need to open new, unvisited recepatacles until you find the object mentioned in the task. Some receptacles cannot be opened so you can directly see what objects after you go to that receptacle.

            You can only use the GotoLocation action to travel to a new location and the OpenObject action (if the receptacle is closed) to verify whether it contains the target object.

        2. Using the Object to Complete the Task:
            Once you have located and picked up the object, update your goal to focus on how the object is used to complete the task. This may involve more than simply transferring it from one place to another.
            For example: You might examine the object or a nearby receptacle to gather information. You may need to use another tool or device (like a lamp or a switch). Some tasks require you to slice, heat, cool, or clean the object using an appropriate receptacle (e.g., microwave, sink, fridge).

            If necessary, use the PickupObject action to retrieve the item, and the GotoLocation action to move to the correct place.
            Then, apply the object in a purposeful way — not just move it — but interact with the environment to fulfill the task’s actual goal.

            Note: if you want to heat, clean, and cool an object, you can go to that receptacle then do the action directly without put the object into that receptacle.
                But if you want to slice an object, you should first go to the receptacle and pick up the sharp object then do the slice action.

        In summary, the first stage is all about finding the object—this might involve going to an unvisited receptacle and opening it if necessary.
        
        Note: 
        1. some receptacles have numbers in their names. Always keep them as they are. For example, "towelholder1" should not be changed to "towelholder".
        2. Your initial goal should always be to go to a new location instead of put something into somewhere.
        3. Do not enter stage 2 when not finishing stage 1.

Looking quickly around you, you see a bathtubbasin 1, a cabinet 4, a cabinet 3, a cabinet 2, a cabinet 1, a countertop 1, a drawer 4, a drawer 3, a drawer 2, a drawer 1, a dresser 1, a garbagecan 1, a handtowelholder 1, a sinkbasin 2, a sinkbasin 1, a toilet 1, a toiletpaperhanger 1, and a towelholder 1.

        You are in an environment that you explore step by step. Based on your observations, generate one valid action at a time to progress in the environment.
        Your task is to interact with objects and receptacles to complete a goal step by step.

        Your specific task goal: Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.

        Here are your current observations: Action: go to handtowelholder 1
You arrive at handtowelholder 1. On the handtowelholder 1, you see a handtowel 1.


        Valid actions you can take (follow exactly this format, replacing the parts in brackets with actual object and location names. Do not include any brackets in your output):
            - go to [towelholder 1]
            - open [cabinet 2]
            - take [cloth 1] from [cabinet 3]
            - move [soap bar 1] to [sink basin 2]
            - use [desk lamp 1]
            - heat [bread 1] with [microwave 1]
            - clean [fork 1] with [sink basin 1]
            - cool [wine bottle 1] with [fridge 1]
            - slice [bread 1] with [knife 1]
        Only replace the object and receptacle names (the words that were inside the brackets) with the actual values from the game environment. Do not change the structure. Do not include brackets.

        Your actions should exactly follow this phrasing — do not invent new formats. Every action must correspond to a valid command from the environment.

        You must go to a receptacle first in order to use/open it or take/put objects from/on it. You can assume all receptacles are freely reachable.

        The process involves two main stages:

        1. Always searching for the aim Object first!!!
            In this stage, your goal is to go to and may need to open new, unvisited recepatacles until you find the object mentioned in the task. Some receptacles cannot be opened so you can directly see what objects after you go to that receptacle.

            You can only use the GotoLocation action to travel to a new location and the OpenObject action (if the receptacle is closed) to verify whether it contains the target object.

        2. Using the Object to Complete the Task:
            Once you have located and picked up the object, update your goal to focus on how the object is used to complete the task. This may involve more than simply transferring it from one place to another.
            For example: You might examine the object or a nearby receptacle to gather information. You may need to use another tool or device (like a lamp or a switch). Some tasks require you to slice, heat, cool, or clean the object using an appropriate receptacle (e.g., microwave, sink, fridge).

            If necessary, use the PickupObject action to retrieve the item, and the GotoLocation action to move to the correct place.
            Then, apply the object in a purposeful way — not just move it — but interact with the environment to fulfill the task’s actual goal.

            Note: if you want to heat, clean, and cool an object, you can go to that receptacle then do the action directly without put the object into that receptacle.
                But if you want to slice an object, you should first go to the receptacle and pick up the sharp object then do the slice action.

        In summary, the first stage is all about finding the object—this might involve going to an unvisited receptacle and opening it if necessary.
        
        Note: 
        1. some receptacles have numbers in their names. Always keep them as they are. For example, "towelholder1" should not be changed to "towelholder".
        2. Your initial goal should always be to go to a new location instead of put something into somewhere.
        3. Do not enter stage 2 when not finishing stage 1.

Prompt: 
        You are in an environment that you explore step by step. Based on your observations, generate one valid action at a time to progress in the environment.
        Your task is to interact with objects and receptacles to complete a goal step by step.

        Your specific task goal: Your task is to: put a clean cloth in toilet.

        Here are your current observations: Action: go to sinkbasin 2
You arrive at sinkbasin 2. On the sinkbasin 2, you see nothing.


        Valid actions you can take (follow exactly this format, replacing the parts in brackets with actual object and location names. Do not include any brackets in your output):
            - go to [towelholder 1]
            - open [cabinet 2]
            - take [cloth 1] from [cabinet 3]
            - move [soap bar 1] to [sink basin 2]
            - use [desk lamp 1]
            - heat [bread 1] with [microwave 1]
            - clean [fork 1] with [sink basin 1]
            - cool [wine bottle 1] with [fridge 1]
            - slice [bread 1] with [knife 1]
        Only replace the object and receptacle names (the words that were inside the brackets) with the actual values from the game environment. Do not change the structure. Do not include brackets.

        Your actions should exactly follow this phrasing — do not invent new formats. Every action must correspond to a valid command from the environment.

        You must go to a receptacle first in order to use/open it or take/put objects from/on it. You can assume all receptacles are freely reachable.

        The process involves two main stages:

        1. Always searching for the aim Object first!!!
            In this stage, your goal is to go to and may need to open new, unvisited recepatacles until you find the object mentioned in the task. Some receptacles cannot be opened so you can directly see what objects after you go to that receptacle.

            You can only use the GotoLocation action to travel to a new location and the OpenObject action (if the receptacle is closed) to verify whether it contains the target object.

        2. Using the Object to Complete the Task:
            Once you have located and picked up the object, update your goal to focus on how the object is used to complete the task. This may involve more than simply transferring it from one place to another.
            For example: You might examine the object or a nearby receptacle to gather information. You may need to use another tool or device (like a lamp or a switch). Some tasks require you to slice, heat, cool, or clean the object using an appropriate receptacle (e.g., microwave, sink, fridge).

            If necessary, use the PickupObject action to retrieve the item, and the GotoLocation action to move to the correct place.
            Then, apply the object in a purposeful way — not just move it — but interact with the environment to fulfill the task’s actual goal.

            Note: if you want to heat, clean, and cool an object, you can go to that receptacle then do the action directly without put the object into that receptacle.
                But if you want to slice an object, you should first go to the receptacle and pick up the sharp object then do the slice action.

        In summary, the first stage is all about finding the object—this might involve going to an unvisited receptacle and opening it if necessary.
        
        Note: 
        1. some receptacles have numbers in their names. Always keep them as they are. For example, "towelholder1" should not be changed to "towelholder".
        2. Your initial goal should always be to go to a new location instead of put something into somewhere.
        3. Do not enter stage 2 when not finishing stage 1.
