        You are in an environment that you must explore step by step. Your task is to build and update PDDL files for the environment using only your direct observations. Do not create or assume any objects, relationships, or details that have not been observed, and ensure you include all observations.

        The environment is a room containing various objects. Some of these objects are on, in, or contained within other objects and receptacles. You will initially be located as init_receptacle. You can assume all receptacles are freely reachable.
        
        Now, Your task is to: clean some lettuce and put it in countertop.
        Here are your current observations: Action: look around
You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you see a cabinet 27, a cabinet 26, a cabinet 25, a cabinet 24, a cabinet 23, a cabinet 22, a cabinet 21, a cabinet 20, a cabinet 19, a cabinet 18, a cabinet 17, a cabinet 16, a cabinet 15, a cabinet 14, a cabinet 13, a cabinet 12, a cabinet 11, a cabinet 10, a cabinet 9, a cabinet 8, a cabinet 7, a cabinet 6, a cabinet 5, a cabinet 4, a cabinet 3, a cabinet 2, a cabinet 1, a coffeemachine 1, a countertop 2, a countertop 1, a diningtable 1, a drawer 12, a drawer 11, a drawer 10, a drawer 9, a drawer 8, a drawer 7, a drawer 6, a drawer 5, a drawer 4, a drawer 3, a drawer 2, a drawer 1, a fridge 1, a garbagecan 1, a microwave 1, a sinkbasin 1, a stoveburner 4, a stoveburner 3, a stoveburner 2, a stoveburner 1, and a toaster 1.


        Only the following actions are allowed: (There are only two types: object and receptacle)
        1. go to a receptacle
            :action GotoLocation
            :parameters (?from - receptacle ?to - receptacle)
        2. open a receptacle if it is closed
            :action OpenObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        3. close a receptacle
            :action CloseObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        4. take an object from another receptacle
            :action PickupObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        5. put object into/on/in another receptacle
            :action PutObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        6. using an object/receptacle by turning it on/off with a switch
            :action useObject
            :parameters (?o - object)
        7. heat an object using a receptacle
            :action HeatObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - microwaveReceptacle)
        8. clean an object using a receptacle
            :action CleanObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - sinkbasinReceptacle)
        9. cool an object using a receptacle
            :action CoolObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - fridgeReceptacle)
        10. slice an object using a sharp object
            :action SliceObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle ?co - object ?sharp_o - sharpObject)

        You must go to a receptacle first in order to use/open it or take/put objects from/on it.

        The process involves two main stages:

        Stage 1: Search for the Target Object
            Goal 1.1: Move to a new, unvisited receptacle using the GotoLocation action.
                You goal should look like this:
                    (:goal 
                        (at ?recepatacle)
                    ) where recepatacle should be somewhere or some recepatacles not visited.
            Goal 1.2: If the receptacle is closed, use the OpenObject action to reveal its contents.
                Your goal should look like this:
                    (:goal 
                        (opened ?recepatacle)
                    ) where recepatacle should be the recepatacle you want to open.

        Stage 2: Use the Object to Complete the Task
            Goal 2.1: Pick up the target object using the PickupObject action.
            Goal 2.2: Move to the appropriate location needed to fulfill the task.
            Goal 2.3: Interact with relevant objects or receptacles (e.g., heat, clean, cool, slice, or use) to accomplish the task.

        Constraints:
            1. Do not assume unseen objects or relationships.
            2. Receptacle names must be preserved exactly.
            3. Do not proceed to Stage 2 before completing Stage 1.

        Note: Always include :negative-preconditions in your :requirements whenever you use (not …) or delete effects, and never leave an :precondition or :effect block empty—either omit it or include at least one literal.

        You are in an environment that you must explore step by step. Your task is to build and update PDDL files for the environment using only your direct observations. Do not create or assume any objects, relationships, or details that have not been observed, and ensure you include all observations.

        The environment is a room containing various objects. Some of these objects are on, in, or contained within other objects and receptacles. You will initially be located as init_receptacle. You can assume all receptacles are freely reachable.
        
        Now, Your task is to: clean some lettuce and put it in countertop.
        Here are your current observations: Action: go to cabinet_ 1
Nothing happens.

Action: open cabinet_ 1
Nothing happens.


        Only the following actions are allowed: (There are only two types: object and receptacle)
        1. go to a receptacle
            :action GotoLocation
            :parameters (?from - receptacle ?to - receptacle)
        2. open a receptacle if it is closed
            :action OpenObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        3. close a receptacle
            :action CloseObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        4. take an object from another receptacle
            :action PickupObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        5. put object into/on/in another receptacle
            :action PutObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        6. using an object/receptacle by turning it on/off with a switch
            :action useObject
            :parameters (?o - object)
        7. heat an object using a receptacle
            :action HeatObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - microwaveReceptacle)
        8. clean an object using a receptacle
            :action CleanObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - sinkbasinReceptacle)
        9. cool an object using a receptacle
            :action CoolObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - fridgeReceptacle)
        10. slice an object using a sharp object
            :action SliceObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle ?co - object ?sharp_o - sharpObject)

        You must go to a receptacle first in order to use/open it or take/put objects from/on it.

        The process involves two main stages:

        Stage 1: Search for the Target Object
            Goal 1.1: Move to a new, unvisited receptacle using the GotoLocation action.
                You goal should look like this:
                    (:goal 
                        (at ?recepatacle)
                    ) where recepatacle should be somewhere or some recepatacles not visited.
            Goal 1.2: If the receptacle is closed, use the OpenObject action to reveal its contents.
                Your goal should look like this:
                    (:goal 
                        (opened ?recepatacle)
                    ) where recepatacle should be the recepatacle you want to open.

        Stage 2: Use the Object to Complete the Task
            Goal 2.1: Pick up the target object using the PickupObject action.
            Goal 2.2: Move to the appropriate location needed to fulfill the task.
            Goal 2.3: Interact with relevant objects or receptacles (e.g., heat, clean, cool, slice, or use) to accomplish the task.

        Constraints:
            1. Do not assume unseen objects or relationships.
            2. Receptacle names must be preserved exactly.
            3. Do not proceed to Stage 2 before completing Stage 1.

        Note: Always include :negative-preconditions in your :requirements whenever you use (not …) or delete effects, and never leave an :precondition or :effect block empty—either omit it or include at least one literal.

        This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations: Action: look around
You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you see a cabinet 27, a cabinet 26, a cabinet 25, a cabinet 24, a cabinet 23, a cabinet 22, a cabinet 21, a cabinet 20, a cabinet 19, a cabinet 18, a cabinet 17, a cabinet 16, a cabinet 15, a cabinet 14, a cabinet 13, a cabinet 12, a cabinet 11, a cabinet 10, a cabinet 9, a cabinet 8, a cabinet 7, a cabinet 6, a cabinet 5, a cabinet 4, a cabinet 3, a cabinet 2, a cabinet 1, a coffeemachine 1, a countertop 2, a countertop 1, a diningtable 1, a drawer 12, a drawer 11, a drawer 10, a drawer 9, a drawer 8, a drawer 7, a drawer 6, a drawer 5, a drawer 4, a drawer 3, a drawer 2, a drawer 1, a fridge 1, a garbagecan 1, a microwave 1, a sinkbasin 1, a stoveburner 4, a stoveburner 3, a stoveburner 2, a stoveburner 1, and a toaster 1.

    
        Now modify those two files according to the new observations and notes. Fix any errors you made in the previous setting according to the new observation.
        Generate updated files based on your new observation.
    
        You have already generate files according to the observations. The df and pf can generate actions but after simulating,
        it got those errors: In this step, you take the following actions and observations from those actions:
                                    Action: go to cabinet_ 1
Nothing happens.
Action: open cabinet_ 1
Nothing happens.
This is the action you take and got something wrong: open cabinet_ 1. You are trying to open a receptacle but nothing happens. 
                                        You should first go to this receptacle to open it. 
                                        But if you have already go to this receptacle and still seeing this error message, it means that this receptacle cannot be opened and you can directly see objects after you go to it. Do not try to open it!!. Please review both files and fix them.
        Now modify those two files according to the error message.

        Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
        The format should strictly be:
            {
            "df": "...",
            "pf": "..."
            }
    
        You are in an environment that you must explore step by step. Your task is to build and update PDDL files for the environment using only your direct observations. Do not create or assume any objects, relationships, or details that have not been observed, and ensure you include all observations.

        The environment is a room containing various objects. Some of these objects are on, in, or contained within other objects and receptacles. You will initially be located as init_receptacle. You can assume all receptacles are freely reachable.
        
        Now, Your task is to: clean some lettuce and put it in countertop.
        Here are your current observations: Action: go to cabinet_ 1
Nothing happens.

Action: take lettuce from cabinet_ 1
Nothing happens.


        Only the following actions are allowed: (There are only two types: object and receptacle)
        1. go to a receptacle
            :action GotoLocation
            :parameters (?from - receptacle ?to - receptacle)
        2. open a receptacle if it is closed
            :action OpenObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        3. close a receptacle
            :action CloseObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        4. take an object from another receptacle
            :action PickupObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        5. put object into/on/in another receptacle
            :action PutObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        6. using an object/receptacle by turning it on/off with a switch
            :action useObject
            :parameters (?o - object)
        7. heat an object using a receptacle
            :action HeatObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - microwaveReceptacle)
        8. clean an object using a receptacle
            :action CleanObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - sinkbasinReceptacle)
        9. cool an object using a receptacle
            :action CoolObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - fridgeReceptacle)
        10. slice an object using a sharp object
            :action SliceObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle ?co - object ?sharp_o - sharpObject)

        You must go to a receptacle first in order to use/open it or take/put objects from/on it.

        The process involves two main stages:

        Stage 1: Search for the Target Object
            Goal 1.1: Move to a new, unvisited receptacle using the GotoLocation action.
                You goal should look like this:
                    (:goal 
                        (at ?recepatacle)
                    ) where recepatacle should be somewhere or some recepatacles not visited.
            Goal 1.2: If the receptacle is closed, use the OpenObject action to reveal its contents.
                Your goal should look like this:
                    (:goal 
                        (opened ?recepatacle)
                    ) where recepatacle should be the recepatacle you want to open.

        Stage 2: Use the Object to Complete the Task
            Goal 2.1: Pick up the target object using the PickupObject action.
            Goal 2.2: Move to the appropriate location needed to fulfill the task.
            Goal 2.3: Interact with relevant objects or receptacles (e.g., heat, clean, cool, slice, or use) to accomplish the task.

        Constraints:
            1. Do not assume unseen objects or relationships.
            2. Receptacle names must be preserved exactly.
            3. Do not proceed to Stage 2 before completing Stage 1.

        Note: Always include :negative-preconditions in your :requirements whenever you use (not …) or delete effects, and never leave an :precondition or :effect block empty—either omit it or include at least one literal.

        This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations: Action: look around
You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you see a cabinet 27, a cabinet 26, a cabinet 25, a cabinet 24, a cabinet 23, a cabinet 22, a cabinet 21, a cabinet 20, a cabinet 19, a cabinet 18, a cabinet 17, a cabinet 16, a cabinet 15, a cabinet 14, a cabinet 13, a cabinet 12, a cabinet 11, a cabinet 10, a cabinet 9, a cabinet 8, a cabinet 7, a cabinet 6, a cabinet 5, a cabinet 4, a cabinet 3, a cabinet 2, a cabinet 1, a coffeemachine 1, a countertop 2, a countertop 1, a diningtable 1, a drawer 12, a drawer 11, a drawer 10, a drawer 9, a drawer 8, a drawer 7, a drawer 6, a drawer 5, a drawer 4, a drawer 3, a drawer 2, a drawer 1, a fridge 1, a garbagecan 1, a microwave 1, a sinkbasin 1, a stoveburner 4, a stoveburner 3, a stoveburner 2, a stoveburner 1, and a toaster 1.

    
        Now modify those two files according to the new observations and notes. Fix any errors you made in the previous setting according to the new observation.
        Generate updated files based on your new observation.
    
        You have already generate files according to the observations. The df and pf can generate actions but after simulating,
        it got those errors: In this step, you take the following actions and observations from those actions:
                                    Action: go to cabinet_ 1
Nothing happens.
Action: take lettuce from cabinet_ 1
Nothing happens.
This is the action you take and got something wrong: take lettuce from cabinet_ 1. You are trying to take something from a receptacle.
                                        You should first go to this receptacle to take the object.
                                        But if you have already go to this receptacle and still seeing this error message, it means that this receptacle doesn't have this object.
                                        You should go to other receptacle to find your aim object. Remember do not assume you can take the object from the receptable but should always set the initial goal as finding that aim object.. Please review both files and fix them.
        Now modify those two files according to the error message.

        You must go to a receptacle first in order to use/open it or take/put objects from/on it.

        The process involves two main stages:

        Stage 1: Search for the Target Object
            Goal 1.1: Move to a new, unvisited receptacle using the GotoLocation action.
                You goal should look like this:
                    (:goal 
                        (at ?recepatacle)
                    ) where recepatacle should be somewhere or some recepatacles not visited.
            Goal 1.2: If the receptacle is closed, use the OpenObject action to reveal its contents.
                Your goal should look like this:
                    (:goal 
                        (opened ?recepatacle)
                    ) where recepatacle should be the recepatacle you want to open.

        Stage 2: Use the Object to Complete the Task
            Goal 2.1: Pick up the target object using the PickupObject action.
            Goal 2.2: Move to the appropriate location needed to fulfill the task.
            Goal 2.3: Interact with relevant objects or receptacles (e.g., heat, clean, cool, slice, or use) to accomplish the task.

        Constraints:
            1. Do not assume unseen objects or relationships.
            2. Receptacle names must be preserved exactly.
            3. Do not proceed to Stage 2 before completing Stage 1.

        Note: Always include :negative-preconditions in your :requirements whenever you use (not …) or delete effects, and never leave an :precondition or :effect block empty—either omit it or include at least one literal.

Looking quickly around you, you see a cabinet 27, a cabinet 26, a cabinet 25, a cabinet 24, a cabinet 23, a cabinet 22, a cabinet 21, a cabinet 20, a cabinet 19, a cabinet 18, a cabinet 17, a cabinet 16, a cabinet 15, a cabinet 14, a cabinet 13, a cabinet 12, a cabinet 11, a cabinet 10, a cabinet 9, a cabinet 8, a cabinet 7, a cabinet 6, a cabinet 5, a cabinet 4, a cabinet 3, a cabinet 2, a cabinet 1, a coffeemachine 1, a countertop 2, a countertop 1, a diningtable 1, a drawer 12, a drawer 11, a drawer 10, a drawer 9, a drawer 8, a drawer 7, a drawer 6, a drawer 5, a drawer 4, a drawer 3, a drawer 2, a drawer 1, a fridge 1, a garbagecan 1, a microwave 1, a sinkbasin 1, a stoveburner 4, a stoveburner 3, a stoveburner 2, a stoveburner 1, and a toaster 1.

    
        You made some mistakes when generating those files. Here is the error message: None; 
warning: parameter ?SHARP_O of op SLICEOBJECT has unknown or empty type SHARPOBJECT. skipping op
ff: goal can be simplified to FALSE. No plan will solve it


        Now modify those two files according to the error message.
    
        You have already generate files according to the observations. The df and pf can generate actions but after simulating,
        it got those errors: In this step, you take the following actions and observations from those actions:
                                    Action: go to cabinet_ 1
Nothing happens.
Action: take lettuce from cabinet_ 1
Nothing happens.
This is the action you take and got something wrong: take lettuce from cabinet_ 1. You are trying to take something from a receptacle.
                                        You should first go to this receptacle to take the object.
                                        But if you have already go to this receptacle and still seeing this error message, it means that this receptacle doesn't have this object.
                                        You should go to other receptacle to find your aim object. Remember do not assume you can take the object from the receptable but should always set the initial goal as finding that aim object.. Please review both files and fix them.
        Now modify those two files according to the error message.

        You are in an environment that you must explore step by step. Your task is to build and update PDDL files for the environment using only your direct observations. Do not create or assume any objects, relationships, or details that have not been observed, and ensure you include all observations.

        The environment is a room containing various objects. Some of these objects are on, in, or contained within other objects and receptacles. You will initially be located as init_receptacle. You can assume all receptacles are freely reachable.
        
        Now, Your task is to: clean some lettuce and put it in countertop.
        Here are your current observations: Action: go to cabinet_ 2
Nothing happens.

Action: open cabinet_ 2
Nothing happens.


        Only the following actions are allowed: (There are only two types: object and receptacle)
        1. go to a receptacle
            :action GotoLocation
            :parameters (?from - receptacle ?to - receptacle)
        2. open a receptacle if it is closed
            :action OpenObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        3. close a receptacle
            :action CloseObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        4. take an object from another receptacle
            :action PickupObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        5. put object into/on/in another receptacle
            :action PutObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        6. using an object/receptacle by turning it on/off with a switch
            :action useObject
            :parameters (?o - object)
        7. heat an object using a receptacle
            :action HeatObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - microwaveReceptacle)
        8. clean an object using a receptacle
            :action CleanObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - sinkbasinReceptacle)
        9. cool an object using a receptacle
            :action CoolObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - fridgeReceptacle)
        10. slice an object using a sharp object
            :action SliceObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle ?co - object ?sharp_o - sharpObject)

        You must go to a receptacle first in order to use/open it or take/put objects from/on it.

        The process involves two main stages:

        Stage 1: Search for the Target Object
            Goal 1.1: Move to a new, unvisited receptacle using the GotoLocation action.
                You goal should look like this:
                    (:goal 
                        (at ?recepatacle)
                    ) where recepatacle should be somewhere or some recepatacles not visited.
            Goal 1.2: If the receptacle is closed, use the OpenObject action to reveal its contents.
                Your goal should look like this:
                    (:goal 
                        (opened ?recepatacle)
                    ) where recepatacle should be the recepatacle you want to open.

        Stage 2: Use the Object to Complete the Task
            Goal 2.1: Pick up the target object using the PickupObject action.
            Goal 2.2: Move to the appropriate location needed to fulfill the task.
            Goal 2.3: Interact with relevant objects or receptacles (e.g., heat, clean, cool, slice, or use) to accomplish the task.

        Constraints:
            1. Do not assume unseen objects or relationships.
            2. Receptacle names must be preserved exactly.
            3. Do not proceed to Stage 2 before completing Stage 1.

        Note: Always include :negative-preconditions in your :requirements whenever you use (not …) or delete effects, and never leave an :precondition or :effect block empty—either omit it or include at least one literal.

        You are in an environment that you must explore step by step. Your task is to build and update PDDL files for the environment using only your direct observations. Do not create or assume any objects, relationships, or details that have not been observed, and ensure you include all observations.

        The environment is a room containing various objects. Some of these objects are on, in, or contained within other objects and receptacles. You will initially be located as init_receptacle. You can assume all receptacles are freely reachable.
        
        Now, Your task is to: clean some lettuce and put it in countertop.
        Here are your current observations: Action: go to cabinet_ 2
Nothing happens.

Action: take lettuce from cabinet_ 2
Nothing happens.


        Only the following actions are allowed: (There are only two types: object and receptacle)
        1. go to a receptacle
            :action GotoLocation
            :parameters (?from - receptacle ?to - receptacle)
        2. open a receptacle if it is closed
            :action OpenObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        3. close a receptacle
            :action CloseObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        4. take an object from another receptacle
            :action PickupObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        5. put object into/on/in another receptacle
            :action PutObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        6. using an object/receptacle by turning it on/off with a switch
            :action useObject
            :parameters (?o - object)
        7. heat an object using a receptacle
            :action HeatObject

        8. clean an object using a receptacle
            :action CleanObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - sinkbasinReceptacle)
        9. cool an object using a receptacle
            :action CoolObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - fridgeReceptacle)
        10. slice an object using a sharp object
            :action SliceObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle ?co - object ?sharp_o - sharpObject)

        You must go to a receptacle first in order to use/open it or take/put objects from/on it.

        The process involves two main stages:

        Stage 1: Search for the Target Object
            Goal 1.1: Move to a new, unvisited receptacle using the GotoLocation action.
                You goal should look like this:
                    (:goal 
                        (at ?recepatacle)
                    ) where recepatacle should be somewhere or some recepatacles not visited.
            Goal 1.2: If the receptacle is closed, use the OpenObject action to reveal its contents.
                Your goal should look like this:
                    (:goal 
                        (opened ?recepatacle)
                    ) where recepatacle should be the recepatacle you want to open.

        Stage 2: Use the Object to Complete the Task
            Goal 2.1: Pick up the target object using the PickupObject action.
            Goal 2.2: Move to the appropriate location needed to fulfill the task.
            Goal 2.3: Interact with relevant objects or receptacles (e.g., heat, clean, cool, slice, or use) to accomplish the task.

        Constraints:
            1. Do not assume unseen objects or relationships.
            2. Receptacle names must be preserved exactly.
            3. Do not proceed to Stage 2 before completing Stage 1.

        Note: Always include :negative-preconditions in your :requirements whenever you use (not …) or delete effects, and never leave an :precondition or :effect block empty—either omit it or include at least one literal.

        This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations: Action: look around
You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you see a cabinet 27, a cabinet 26, a cabinet 25, a cabinet 24, a cabinet 23, a cabinet 22, a cabinet 21, a cabinet 20, a cabinet 19, a cabinet 18, a cabinet 17, a cabinet 16, a cabinet 15, a cabinet 14, a cabinet 13, a cabinet 12, a cabinet 11, a cabinet 10, a cabinet 9, a cabinet 8, a cabinet 7, a cabinet 6, a cabinet 5, a cabinet 4, a cabinet 3, a cabinet 2, a cabinet 1, a coffeemachine 1, a countertop 2, a countertop 1, a diningtable 1, a drawer 12, a drawer 11, a drawer 10, a drawer 9, a drawer 8, a drawer 7, a drawer 6, a drawer 5, a drawer 4, a drawer 3, a drawer 2, a drawer 1, a fridge 1, a garbagecan 1, a microwave 1, a sinkbasin 1, a stoveburner 4, a stoveburner 3, a stoveburner 2, a stoveburner 1, and a toaster 1.

    
        Now modify those two files according to the new observations and notes. Fix any errors you made in the previous setting according to the new observation.
        Generate updated files based on your new observation.
    
        You have already generate files according to the observations. The df and pf can generate actions but after simulating,
        it got those errors: In this step, you take the following actions and observations from those actions:
                                    Action: go to cabinet_ 2
Nothing happens.
Action: take lettuce from cabinet_ 2
Nothing happens.
This is the action you take and got something wrong: take lettuce from cabinet_ 2. You are trying to take something from a receptacle.
                                        You should first go to this receptacle to take the object.
                                        But if you have already go to this receptacle and still seeing this error message, it means that this receptacle doesn't have this object.
                                        You should go to other receptacle to find your aim object. Remember do not assume you can take the object from the receptable but should always set the initial goal as finding that aim object.. Please review both files and fix them.
        Now modify those two files according to the error message.

        This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations: Action: look around
You are in the middle of a room.

        You made some mistakes when generating those files. Here is the error message: None; 
ff: goal can be simplified to FALSE. No plan will solve it


        Now modify those two files according to the error message.
    
        You have already generate files according to the observations. The df and pf can generate actions but after simulating,
        it got those errors: In this step, you take the following actions and observations from those actions:
                                    Action: go to cabinet_ 2
Nothing happens.
Action: take lettuce from cabinet_ 2
Nothing happens.
This is the action you take and got something wrong: take lettuce from cabinet_ 2. You are trying to take something from a receptacle.
                                        You should first go to this receptacle to take the object.
                                        But if you have already go to this receptacle and still seeing this error message, it means that this receptacle doesn't have this object.
                                        You should go to other receptacle to find your aim object. Remember do not assume you can take the object from the receptable but should always set the initial goal as finding that aim object.. Please review both files and fix them.
        Now modify those two files according to the error message.
