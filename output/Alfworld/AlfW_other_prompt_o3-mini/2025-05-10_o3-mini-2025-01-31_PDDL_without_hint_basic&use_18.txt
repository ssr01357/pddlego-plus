Do not create or assume any objects, relationships, or details that have not been observed, and ensure you include all observations.

        The environment is a room containing various objects. Some of these objects are on, in, or contained within other objects and receptacles. You will initially be located as init_receptacle. You can assume all receptacles are freely reachable.
        
        Now, Your task is to: look at bowl under the desklamp.
        Here are your current observations: Action: look around
You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you see a bed 1, a desk 1, a drawer 2, a drawer 1, a garbagecan 1, a shelf 1, and a sidetable 1.


        Only the following actions are allowed: (There are only two types: object and receptacle)
        1. go to a receptacle
            :action GotoLocation
            :parameters (?from - receptacle ?to - receptacle)
        2. open a receptacle if it is closed
            :action OpenObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        3. close a receptacle
            :action CloseObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        4. take an object from another receptacle
            :action PickupObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        5. put object into/on/in another receptacle
            :action PutObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        6. using an object/receptacle by turning it on/off with a switch
            :action useObject
            :parameters (?o - object)
        7. heat an object using a receptacle
            :action HeatObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - microwaveReceptacle)
        8. clean an object using a receptacle
            :action CleanObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - sinkbasinReceptacle)
        9. cool an object using a receptacle
            :action CoolObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - fridgeReceptacle)
        10. slice an object using a sharp object
            :action SliceObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle ?co - object ?sharp_o - sharpObject)

        You must go to a receptacle first in order to use/open it or take/put objects from/on it.

        The process involves two main stages:

        Stage 1: Search for the Target Object
            Goal 1.1: Move to a new, unvisited receptacle using the GotoLocation action.
                You goal should look like this:
                    (:goal 
                        (at ?recepatacle)
                    ) where recepatacle should be somewhere or some recepatacles not visited.
            Goal 1.2: If the receptacle is closed, use the OpenObject action to reveal its contents.
                Your goal should look like this:
                    (:goal 
                        (opened ?recepatacle)
                    ) where recepatacle should be the recepatacle you want to open.

        Stage 2: Use the Object to Complete the Task
            Goal 2.1: Pick up the target object using the PickupObject action.
            Goal 2.2: Move to the appropriate location needed to fulfill the task.
            Goal 2.3: Interact with relevant objects or receptacles (e.g., heat, clean, cool, slice, or use) to accomplish the task.

        Constraints:
            1. Do not assume unseen objects or relationships.
            2. Receptacle names must be preserved exactly.
            3. Do not proceed to Stage 2 before completing Stage 1.

        Note: Always include :negative-preconditions in your :requirements whenever you use (not …) or delete effects, and never leave an :precondition or :effect block empty—either omit it or include at least one literal.

            Goal 1.2: If the receptacle is closed, use the OpenObject action to reveal its contents.
                Your goal should look like this:
                    (:goal 
                        (opened ?recepatacle)
                    ) where recepatacle should be the recepatacle you want to open.

        Stage 2: Use the Object to Complete the Task
            Goal 2.1: Pick up the target object using the PickupObject action.
            Goal 2.2: Move to the appropriate location needed to fulfill the task.
            Goal 2.3: Interact with relevant objects or receptacles (e.g., heat, clean, cool, slice, or use) to accomplish the task.

        Constraints:
            1. Do not assume unseen objects or relationships.
            2. Receptacle names must be preserved exactly.
            3. Do not proceed to Stage 2 before completing Stage 1.

        The environment is a room containing various objects. Some of these objects are on, in, or contained within other objects and receptacles. You will initially be located as init_receptacle. You can assume all receptacles are freely reachable.
        
        Now, Your task is to: look at bowl under the desklamp.
        Here are your current observations: Action: go to desk
Nothing happens.


        Only the following actions are allowed: (There are only two types: object and receptacle)

            :action SliceObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle ?co - object ?sharp_o - sharpObject)

        You must go to a receptacle first in order to use/open it or take/put objects from/on it.

        The process involves two main stages:

        Stage 1: Search for the Target Object
            Goal 1.1: Move to a new, unvisited receptacle using the GotoLocation action.
                You goal should look like this:
                    (:goal 
                        (at ?recepatacle)
                    ) where recepatacle should be somewhere or some recepatacles not visited.
            Goal 1.2: If the receptacle is closed, use the OpenObject action to reveal its contents.
                Your goal should look like this:
                    (:goal 
                        (opened ?recepatacle)
                    ) where recepatacle should be the recepatacle you want to open.

        Stage 2: Use the Object to Complete the Task
            Goal 2.1: Pick up the target object using the PickupObject action.
            Goal 2.2: Move to the appropriate location needed to fulfill the task.
            Goal 2.3: Interact with relevant objects or receptacles (e.g., heat, clean, cool, slice, or use) to accomplish the task.

        Constraints:
            1. Do not assume unseen objects or relationships.
            2. Receptacle names must be preserved exactly.
            3. Do not proceed to Stage 2 before completing Stage 1.

        You must go to a receptacle first in order to use/open it or take/put objects from/on it.

        The process involves two main stages:

        Stage 1: Search for the Target Object
            Goal 1.1: Move to a new, unvisited receptacle using the GotoLocation action.
                You goal should look like this:
                    (:goal 
                        (at ?recepatacle)
                    ) where recepatacle should be somewhere or some recepatacles not visited.
            Goal 1.2: If the receptacle is closed, use the OpenObject action to reveal its contents.
                Your goal should look like this:
                    (:goal 
                        (opened ?recepatacle)
                    ) where recepatacle should be the recepatacle you want to open.

        Stage 2: Use the Object to Complete the Task
            Goal 2.1: Pick up the target object using the PickupObject action.
            Goal 2.2: Move to the appropriate location needed to fulfill the task.
            Goal 2.3: Interact with relevant objects or receptacles (e.g., heat, clean, cool, slice, or use) to accomplish the task.

        Constraints:
            1. Do not assume unseen objects or relationships.
            2. Receptacle names must be preserved exactly.
            3. Do not proceed to Stage 2 before completing Stage 1.

                                    Action: open desk
Nothing happens.
This is the action you take and got something wrong: open desk. You are trying to open a receptacle but nothing happens. 
                                        You should first go to this receptacle to open it. 
                                        But if you have already go to this receptacle and still seeing this error message, it means that this receptacle cannot be opened and you can directly see objects after you go to it. Do not try to open it!!. Please review both files and fix them.

            :action SliceObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle ?co - object ?sharp_o - sharpObject)

        You must go to a receptacle first in order to use/open it or take/put objects from/on it.

        The process involves two main stages:

        Stage 1: Search for the Target Object
            Goal 1.1: Move to a new, unvisited receptacle using the GotoLocation action.
                You goal should look like this:
                    (:goal 
                        (at ?recepatacle)
                    ) where recepatacle should be somewhere or some recepatacles not visited.
            Goal 1.2: If the receptacle is closed, use the OpenObject action to reveal its contents.
                Your goal should look like this:
                    (:goal 
                        (opened ?recepatacle)
                    ) where recepatacle should be the recepatacle you want to open.

        Stage 2: Use the Object to Complete the Task
            Goal 2.1: Pick up the target object using the PickupObject action.
            Goal 2.2: Move to the appropriate location needed to fulfill the task.
            Goal 2.3: Interact with relevant objects or receptacles (e.g., heat, clean, cool, slice, or use) to accomplish the task.

        Constraints:
            1. Do not assume unseen objects or relationships.
            2. Receptacle names must be preserved exactly.
            3. Do not proceed to Stage 2 before completing Stage 1.

        Note: Always include :negative-preconditions in your :requirements whenever you use (not …) or delete effects, and never leave an :precondition or :effect block empty—either omit it or include at least one literal.

        This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations: Action: look around
You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you see a bed 1, a desk 1, a drawer 2, a drawer 1, a garbagecan 1, a shelf 1, and a sidetable 1.

                                    Action: open desk
Nothing happens.
This is the action you take and got something wrong: open desk. You are trying to open a receptacle but nothing happens. 
                                        You should first go to this receptacle to open it. 
                                        But if you have already go to this receptacle and still seeing this error message, it means that this receptacle cannot be opened and you can directly see objects after you go to it. Do not try to open it!!. Please review both files and fix them.

        You are in an environment that you must explore step by step. Your task is to build and update PDDL files for the environment using only your direct observations. Do not create or assume any objects, relationships, or details that have not been observed, and ensure you include all observations.

        The environment is a room containing various objects. Some of these objects are on, in, or contained within other objects and receptacles. You will initially be located as init_receptacle. You can assume all receptacles are freely reachable.
        
        Now, Your task is to: look at bowl under the desklamp.
        Here are your current observations: Action: go to desklamp
Nothing happens.


        Only the following actions are allowed: (There are only two types: object and receptacle)
        1. go to a receptacle
            :action GotoLocation
            :parameters (?from - receptacle ?to - receptacle)
        2. open a receptacle if it is closed
            :action OpenObject

        3. close a receptacle
            :action CloseObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle)
        4. take an object from another receptacle
            :action PickupObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        5. put object into/on/in another receptacle
            :action PutObject
            :parameters (?o - object ?r - receptacle)
        6. using an object/receptacle by turning it on/off with a switch
            :action useObject
            :parameters (?o - object)
        7. heat an object using a receptacle
            :action HeatObject

        10. slice an object using a sharp object
            :action SliceObject
            :parameters (?r - receptacle ?co - object ?sharp_o - sharpObject)

        You must go to a receptacle first in order to use/open it or take/put objects from/on it.

        The process involves two main stages:

        Stage 1: Search for the Target Object
            Goal 1.1: Move to a new, unvisited receptacle using the GotoLocation action.
                You goal should look like this:
                    (:goal 
                        (at ?recepatacle)
                    ) where recepatacle should be somewhere or some recepatacles not visited.
            Goal 1.2: If the receptacle is closed, use the OpenObject action to reveal its contents.
                Your goal should look like this:
                    (:goal 
                        (opened ?recepatacle)
                    ) where recepatacle should be the recepatacle you want to open.

        Stage 2: Use the Object to Complete the Task
            Goal 2.1: Pick up the target object using the PickupObject action.
            Goal 2.2: Move to the appropriate location needed to fulfill the task.
            Goal 2.3: Interact with relevant objects or receptacles (e.g., heat, clean, cool, slice, or use) to accomplish the task.

        Constraints:
            1. Do not assume unseen objects or relationships.
            2. Receptacle names must be preserved exactly.
            3. Do not proceed to Stage 2 before completing Stage 1.

        Note: Always include :negative-preconditions in your :requirements whenever you use (not …) or delete effects, and never leave an :precondition or :effect block empty—either omit it or include at least one literal.
