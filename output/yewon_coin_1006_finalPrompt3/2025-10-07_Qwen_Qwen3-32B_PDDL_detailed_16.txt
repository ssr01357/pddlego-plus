Observations: You are in the kitchen. In one part of the room you see a stove. There is also an oven. You also see a fridge that is closed. In another part of the room you see a counter, that has nothing on it. In one part of the room you see a kitchen cupboard that is closed. There is also a cutlery drawer that is closed. You also see a trash can that is closed. In another part of the room you see a dishwasher that is closed. In one part of the room you see a dining chair, that has nothing on it. 
To the North you see the corridor. To the West you see a closed frosted-glass door.

You are in a partially observable environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
Here are your current observations: Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see the corridor. To the West you see a closed frosted-glass door. 

Here are some valid actions you can take: ['move east', 'move north', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to east', 'open door to north', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']
You should generate df and pf that strictly follow these action schemas. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:
1. :action open-door
    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
2. :action move
    :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
You should have a goal in the problem file like this:

Note: 
- In problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status.
- In problem file's goal, ?location must be grounded, no variables or quantifiers.

Prompt: 
    Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
    The format should strictly be:
        {
        "df": "...",
        "pf": "..."
        }


You are in a partially observable environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
Here are your current observations: Action: move north
You can't move there, the door is closed. 

Here are some valid actions you can take: ['move east', 'move north', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to east', 'open door to north', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']
You should generate df and pf that strictly follow these action schemas. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:
1. :action open-door
    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
2. :action move
    :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
You should have a goal in the problem file like this: 
(:goal 
    (at ?location)
) 


Note: 
- In problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status.
- In problem file's goal, ?location must be grounded, no variables or quantifiers.


This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations: 
Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see the corridor. To the West you see a closed frosted-glass door. 
Action: move north
You are in the corridor. To the North you see a closed wood door. To the South you see the kitchen. To the East you see a closed screen door. To the West you see a closed wood door. 
Action: move north
You can't move there, the door is closed. 


You have already generated df and pf files according to the observations.
This is previous domain file: 
(define (domain exploration)
    (:requirements :strips :typing)
    (:types location direction direction-type)
    (:predicates
        (at ?l - location)
        (connected ?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)

    )
    (:action open-door
        :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction ?type - direction-type)
        :precondition (and (closed ?loc1 ?dir ?type) (connected ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir))
        :effect (not (closed ?loc1 ?dir ?type))
    )
    (:action move
        :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
        :precondition (and (at ?from) (connected ?from ?to ?dir))
        :effect (and (not (at ?from)) (at ?to))
    )
)

    )
    (:goal

Based on the df and pf that you generated, the external solver could generate a plan but after simulating in the game environment, it caused those errors: 
This is the action you take: move north. The door that you are moving to is closed. You should first open door to that direction then move there!


Now rewrite both the domain and problem files with the minimal fix.

 You are in the bathroom. In one part of the room you see a dressing table, that has nothing on it. There is also a sink, that has nothing on it. You also see a wall hook, that has nothing on it. In another part of the room you see a bath mat. In one part of the room you see a toilet roll holder, that has nothing on it. There is also a towel rack, that has nothing on it. You also see a bath tub, that has nothing on it. In another part of the room you see a shower, that has nothing on it. In one part of the room you see a trash can that is closed. There is also a bathroom cabinet that is closed. You also see a toilet. 
To the North you see a closed wood door. Through an open wood door, to the South you see the corridor. To the East you see a closed wood door.
