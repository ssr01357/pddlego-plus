You are in a partially observable environment that you explore step by step. Your task is to generate a PDDL domain file ('df') based on the observations and valid actions.
Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.

Here are your current observations: Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see the living room. To the South you see a closed frosted-glass door. 

Here are some valid actions you can take: ['move east', 'move north', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to east', 'open door to north', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']

You should generate a df that strictly follows these valid actions. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:
1. :action open-door
    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
2. :action move

You are in a partially observable environment that you explore step by step. Your task is to define the objects and the initial state for a PDDL problem file ('pf') based on the provided domain file ('df') and your current observations from the environment.
**DO NOT** generate the `(:goal ...)` section in this step. 

Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.

If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.

This is the domain file: (define (domain exploration)
  (:types location direction)
  (:predicates
    (door-connects ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
    (closed ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)

You are in a partially observable environment that you explore step by step. Your output must be one single, complete PDDL problem file. To create it, add a `(:goal ...)` section to the provided objects and initial state, then wrap everything in the standard `(define (problem ...))` structure.

Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
In other words, your goal should be to go to another not visited location.

This is the domain file:
(define (domain exploration)
  (:types location direction)
  (:predicates
    (door-connects ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
    (closed ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
    (at ?loc - location)
  )
  (:action open-door
    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
    :precondition (and (at ?loc1) (door-connects ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir) (closed ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir))
    :effect (not (closed ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir))
  )
  (:action move
    :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
    :precondition (and (at ?from) (door-connects ?from ?to ?dir) (not (closed ?from ?to ?dir)))
    :effect (and (at ?to) (not (at ?from)))
  )
)

Here are your current observations: Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see the living room. To the South you see a closed frosted-glass door. 

Here are some valid actions you can take: ['move east', 'move north', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to east', 'open door to north', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']

This is the objects and initial state of the problem file:
(define (problem exploration-p1)
  (:domain exploration)
  (:objects
    kitchen - location
    living-room - location
    south-room - location
    north - direction
    south - direction

  (:init
    (door-connects kitchen living-room north)
    (door-connects kitchen south-room south)
    (closed kitchen south-room south)
    (at kitchen)
  )
)

You should have a goal in the problem file like this: 
(:goal 
    (at ?location)
)


Note: 
- In problem file's goal, ?location must be grounded, no variables or quantifiers.

In another part of the room you see a arm chair, that has nothing on it. In one part of the room you see a side table, that has nothing on it. There is also a coffee table, that has nothing on it.

You are in a partially observable environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
Here are your current observations: Action: move north
You are in the living room. To the North you see the corridor. To the South you see the kitchen. To the East you see a closed wood door. To the West you see a closed patio door. 

Here are some valid actions you can take: ['move east', 'move north', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to east', 'open door to north', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']
You should generate df and pf that strictly follow these action schemas. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:
1. :action open-door
    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
2. :action move
    :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
You should have a goal in the problem file like this: 
(:goal 
    (at ?location)

Note: 
- In problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status.
- In problem file's goal, ?location must be grounded, no variables or quantifiers.


This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations: 
Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see the living room. To the South you see a closed frosted-glass door. 
Action: move north
You are in the living room. To the North you see the corridor. To the South you see the kitchen. To the East you see a closed wood door. To the West you see a closed patio door. 


You have already generated df and pf files according to the observations.
This is previous domain file: 
(define (domain exploration)
  (:types location direction)
  (:predicates
    (door-connects ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
    (closed ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
    (at ?loc - location)
  )
  (:action open-door
    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
    :precondition (and (at ?loc1) (door-connects ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir) (closed ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir))
    :effect (not (closed ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir))
  )
  (:action move
    :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
    :precondition (and (at ?from) (door-connects ?from ?to ?dir) (not (closed ?from ?to ?dir)))
    :effect (and (at ?to) (not (at ?from)))
  )
)

This is previous problem file: 
(define (problem exploration-p1)
  (:domain exploration)
  (:objects
    kitchen - location
    living-room - location
    south-room - location
    north - direction

    (door-connects kitchen south-room south)
    (closed kitchen south-room south)
    (at kitchen)

  (:goal

Now rewrite both the domain and problem files with the minimal fix.
