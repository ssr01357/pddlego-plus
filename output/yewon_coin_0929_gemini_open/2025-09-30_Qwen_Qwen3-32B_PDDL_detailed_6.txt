    Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
    The format should strictly be:
        {
        "df": "...",
        "pf": "..."
        }

    You are in a partially observable environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files based ONLY on your observations. 
    Do not invent information. Crucially, you do NOT know where a closed door leads until you open it.

    Here are your current observations: Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see a closed plain door. To the West you see the living room. 

    Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to north', 'move north', 'move west', 'open door to north']

    You must generate the DF and PF strictly following these action schemas:
    1. :action open-door
        :parameters (?loc - location ?dir - direction)
        ;; Used for discovery. Does NOT require knowing the destination.
    2. :action move
        :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
        ;; Requires known connection and open path.

    Key Predicates (must be defined in DF and used in PF):
    - (at ?loc)
    - (has-door ?loc ?dir): A door exists at ?loc in ?dir.
    - (door-is-closed ?loc ?dir) / (door-is-open ?loc ?dir): State of the door.
    - (connected ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir): Connection knowledge discovered AFTER opening a door or observing an open passage.

    Exploration Strategy & State Representation:
    1. If you see a closed door, use (has-door) and (door-is-closed). Do NOT use (connected).
    2. When an action reveals a new location (e.g., "revealing the laundry room"), you MUST update the PF to include the new location object AND the (connected ...) facts for both directions.
    
    Goal Setting (Must be grounded, e.g., (at room_x), no variables or quantifiers):
    - Priority 1: Information Gathering. If there are closed doors at the current location, the goal should be to open one:
      (:goal (door-is-open ?current_loc ?unexplored_dir))
    - Priority 2: Movement. If paths are open and connections known, the goal should be to move to an unvisited location:
      (:goal (at ?unvisited_location))

    Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status.

You are in the living room. To the South you see a closed screen door. To the East you see the kitchen. To the West you see a closed wood door. 

    Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to south', 'close door to west', 'move east', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']

    You must generate the DF and PF strictly following these action schemas:
    1. :action open-door
        :parameters (?loc - location ?dir - direction)
        ;; Used for discovery. Does NOT require knowing the destination.
    2. :action move
        :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
        ;; Requires known connection and open path.

    Key Predicates (must be defined in DF and used in PF):
    - (at ?loc)
    - (has-door ?loc ?dir): A door exists at ?loc in ?dir.
    - (door-is-closed ?loc ?dir) / (door-is-open ?loc ?dir): State of the door.
    - (connected ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir): Connection knowledge discovered AFTER opening a door or observing an open passage.

    Exploration Strategy & State Representation:
    1. If you see a closed door, use (has-door) and (door-is-closed). Do NOT use (connected).
    2. When an action reveals a new location (e.g., "revealing the laundry room"), you MUST update the PF to include the new location object AND the (connected ...) facts for both directions.
    
    Goal Setting (Must be grounded, e.g., (at room_x), no variables or quantifiers):
    - Priority 1: Information Gathering. If there are closed doors at the current location, the goal should be to open one:
      (:goal (door-is-open ?current_loc ?unexplored_dir))
    - Priority 2: Movement. If paths are open and connections known, the goal should be to move to an unvisited location:
      (:goal (at ?unvisited_location))

    Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status.

This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations: 
Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see a closed plain door. To the West you see the living room. 
Action: open door to north
You open the plain door, revealing the pantry. 
Action: move north
You are in the pantry. Through an open plain door, to the South you see the kitchen. 
Action: move south
You are in the kitchen. Through an open plain door, to the North you see the pantry. To the West you see the living room. 
Action: move west
You are in the living room. To the South you see a closed screen door. To the East you see the kitchen. To the West you see a closed wood door. 

You have already generated df and pf files according to the observations.

--Small Loop--: 0 
Prompt: 
    Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
    The format should strictly be:
        {
        "df": "...",
        "pf": "..."
        }

    You are in a partially observable environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files based ONLY on your observations. 
    Do not invent information. Crucially, you do NOT know where a closed door leads until you open it.

    Here are your current observations: Action: open door to east
You open the commercial glass door, revealing the supermarket. 

    Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to east', 'move east', 'move west', 'open door to east']

    You must generate the DF and PF strictly following these action schemas:
    1. :action open-door
        :parameters (?loc - location ?dir - direction)
        ;; Used for discovery. Does NOT require knowing the destination.
    2. :action move
        :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
        ;; Requires known connection and open path.

    Key Predicates (must be defined in DF and used in PF):
    - (at ?loc)
    - (has-door ?loc ?dir): A door exists at ?loc in ?dir.
    - (door-is-closed ?loc ?dir) / (door-is-open ?loc ?dir): State of the door.
    - (connected ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir): Connection knowledge discovered AFTER opening a door or observing an open passage.

    Exploration Strategy & State Representation:
    1. If you see a closed door, use (has-door) and (door-is-closed). Do NOT use (connected).
    2. When an action reveals a new location (e.g., "revealing the laundry room"), you MUST update the PF to include the new location object AND the (connected ...) facts for both directions.
    
    Goal Setting (Must be grounded, e.g., (at room_x), no variables or quantifiers):
    - Priority 1: Information Gathering. If there are closed doors at the current location, the goal should be to open one:
      (:goal (door-is-open ?current_loc ?unexplored_dir))
    - Priority 2: Movement. If paths are open and connections known, the goal should be to move to an unvisited location:
      (:goal (at ?unvisited_location))

    Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status.

This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations: 
Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see a closed plain door. To the West you see the living room. 
Action: open door to north
You open the plain door, revealing the pantry. 
Action: move north
You are in the pantry. Through an open plain door, to the South you see the kitchen.

Raw plan text:  
--Small Loop--: 1 
Prompt: 
    Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
    The format should strictly be:
        {
        "df": "...",
        "pf": "..."
        }

    You are in a partially observable environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files based ONLY on your observations. 
    Do not invent information. Crucially, you do NOT know where a closed door leads until you open it.

    Here are your current observations: Action: move west
You are in the street. Through an open commercial glass door, to the East you see the supermarket. To the West you see the backyard. 

    Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to east', 'move east', 'move west', 'open door to east']

    You must generate the DF and PF strictly following these action schemas:
    1. :action open-door
        :parameters (?loc - location ?dir - direction)
        ;; Used for discovery. Does NOT require knowing the destination.
    2. :action move
        :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
        ;; Requires known connection and open path.

    Key Predicates (must be defined in DF and used in PF):
    - (at ?loc)
    - (has-door ?loc ?dir): A door exists at ?loc in ?dir.
    - (door-is-closed ?loc ?dir) / (door-is-open ?loc ?dir): State of the door.
    - (connected ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir): Connection knowledge discovered AFTER opening a door or observing an open passage.

    Exploration Strategy & State Representation:
    1. If you see a closed door, use (has-door) and (door-is-closed). Do NOT use (connected).
    2. When an action reveals a new location (e.g., "revealing the laundry room"), you MUST update the PF to include the new location object AND the (connected ...) facts for both directions.
    
    Goal Setting (Must be grounded, e.g., (at room_x), no variables or quantifiers):
    - Priority 1: Information Gathering. If there are closed doors at the current location, the goal should be to open one:
      (:goal (door-is-open ?current_loc ?unexplored_dir))
    - Priority 2: Movement. If paths are open and connections known, the goal should be to move to an unvisited location:
      (:goal (at ?unvisited_location))

    Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status.

 You are in the bathroom. In one part of the room you see a dressing table, that has nothing on it. There is also a sink, that has nothing on it. You also see a wall hook, that has nothing on it. In another part of the room you see a bath mat. In one part of the room you see a toilet roll holder, that has nothing on it. There is also a towel rack, that has nothing on it. You also see a bath tub, that has nothing on it. In another part of the room you see a shower, that has nothing on it. In one part of the room you see a trash can that is closed. There is also a bathroom cabinet that is closed. You also see a toilet. 
To the South you see a closed wood door. Through an open wood door, to the East you see the living room. To the West you see a closed wood door.

Prompt: 
    Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
    The format should strictly be:
        {
        "df": "...",
        "pf": "..."
        }

    You are in a partially observable environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files based ONLY on your observations. 
    Do not invent information. Crucially, you do NOT know where a closed door leads until you open it.

    Here are your current observations: Action: move west
You are in the bathroom. To the South you see a closed wood door. Through an open wood door, to the East you see the living room. To the West you see a closed wood door. 

    Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to east', 'close door to south', 'close door to west', 'move east', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to east', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']

    You must generate the DF and PF strictly following these action schemas:
    1. :action open-door
        :parameters (?loc - location ?dir - direction)
        ;; Used for discovery. Does NOT require knowing the destination.
    2. :action move
        :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
        ;; Requires known connection and open path.

    Key Predicates (must be defined in DF and used in PF):
    - (at ?loc)
    - (has-door ?loc ?dir): A door exists at ?loc in ?dir.
    - (door-is-closed ?loc ?dir) / (door-is-open ?loc ?dir): State of the door.
    - (connected ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir): Connection knowledge discovered AFTER opening a door or observing an open passage.

    Exploration Strategy & State Representation:
    1. If you see a closed door, use (has-door) and (door-is-closed). Do NOT use (connected).
    2. When an action reveals a new location (e.g., "revealing the laundry room"), you MUST update the PF to include the new location object AND the (connected ...) facts for both directions.
    
    Goal Setting (Must be grounded, e.g., (at room_x), no variables or quantifiers):
    - Priority 1: Information Gathering. If there are closed doors at the current location, the goal should be to open one:
      (:goal (door-is-open ?current_loc ?unexplored_dir))
    - Priority 2: Movement. If paths are open and connections known, the goal should be to move to an unvisited location:
      (:goal (at ?unvisited_location))

    Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status.

This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations:

Prompt: 
    Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
    The format should strictly be:
        {
        "df": "...",
        "pf": "..."
        }

    You are in a partially observable environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files based ONLY on your observations. 
    Do not invent information. Crucially, you do NOT know where a closed door leads until you open it.

    Here are your current observations: Action: open door to south
That is already open. 

    Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to east', 'close door to south', 'close door to west', 'move east', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to east', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']

    You must generate the DF and PF strictly following these action schemas:
    1. :action open-door
        :parameters (?loc - location ?dir - direction)
        ;; Used for discovery. Does NOT require knowing the destination.
    2. :action move
        :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
        ;; Requires known connection and open path.

    Key Predicates (must be defined in DF and used in PF):
    - (at ?loc)
    - (has-door ?loc ?dir): A door exists at ?loc in ?dir.
    - (door-is-closed ?loc ?dir) / (door-is-open ?loc ?dir): State of the door.
    - (connected ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir): Connection knowledge discovered AFTER opening a door or observing an open passage.

    Exploration Strategy & State Representation:
    1. If you see a closed door, use (has-door) and (door-is-closed). Do NOT use (connected).
    2. When an action reveals a new location (e.g., "revealing the laundry room"), you MUST update the PF to include the new location object AND the (connected ...) facts for both directions.
    
    Goal Setting (Must be grounded, e.g., (at room_x), no variables or quantifiers):
    - Priority 1: Information Gathering. If there are closed doors at the current location, the goal should be to open one:
      (:goal (door-is-open ?current_loc ?unexplored_dir))
    - Priority 2: Movement. If paths are open and connections known, the goal should be to move to an unvisited location:
      (:goal (at ?unvisited_location))

    Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status.

Prompt: 
    Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
    The format should strictly be:
        {
        "df": "...",
        "pf": "..."
        }

    You are in a partially observable environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files based ONLY on your observations. 
    Do not invent information. Crucially, you do NOT know where a closed door leads until you open it.

    Here are your current observations: Action: open door to west
You open the wood door, revealing the laundry room. 

    Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to east', 'close door to south', 'close door to west', 'move east', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to east', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']

    You must generate the DF and PF strictly following these action schemas:
    1. :action open-door
        :parameters (?loc - location ?dir - direction)
        ;; Used for discovery. Does NOT require knowing the destination.
    2. :action move
        :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
        ;; Requires known connection and open path.

    Key Predicates (must be defined in DF and used in PF):
    - (at ?loc)
    - (has-door ?loc ?dir): A door exists at ?loc in ?dir.
    - (door-is-closed ?loc ?dir) / (door-is-open ?loc ?dir): State of the door.
    - (connected ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir): Connection knowledge discovered AFTER opening a door or observing an open passage.

    Exploration Strategy & State Representation:
    1. If you see a closed door, use (has-door) and (door-is-closed). Do NOT use (connected).
    2. When an action reveals a new location (e.g., "revealing the laundry room"), you MUST update the PF to include the new location object AND the (connected ...) facts for both directions.
    
    Goal Setting (Must be grounded, e.g., (at room_x), no variables or quantifiers):
    - Priority 1: Information Gathering. If there are closed doors at the current location, the goal should be to open one:
      (:goal (door-is-open ?current_loc ?unexplored_dir))
    - Priority 2: Movement. If paths are open and connections known, the goal should be to move to an unvisited location:
      (:goal (at ?unvisited_location))

    Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status.

This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations:

Prompt: 
    Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
    The format should strictly be:
        {
        "df": "...",
        "pf": "..."
        }

    You are in a partially observable environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files based ONLY on your observations. 
    Do not invent information. Crucially, you do NOT know where a closed door leads until you open it.

    Here are your current observations: Action: move east
You are in the living room. Through an open screen door, to the South you see the backyard. To the East you see the kitchen. Through an open wood door, to the West you see the bathroom. 

Action: move south
You are in the backyard. Through an open screen door, to the North you see the living room. To the East you see the street. To the West you see a closed patio door. 

Action: open door to west
You open the patio door, revealing the corridor. 

    Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to north', 'close door to west', 'move east', 'move north', 'move west', 'open door to north', 'open door to west']

    You must generate the DF and PF strictly following these action schemas:
    1. :action open-door
        :parameters (?loc - location ?dir - direction)
        ;; Used for discovery. Does NOT require knowing the destination.
    2. :action move
        :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
        ;; Requires known connection and open path.

    Key Predicates (must be defined in DF and used in PF):
    - (at ?loc)
    - (has-door ?loc ?dir): A door exists at ?loc in ?dir.
    - (door-is-closed ?loc ?dir) / (door-is-open ?loc ?dir): State of the door.
    - (connected ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir): Connection knowledge discovered AFTER opening a door or observing an open passage.

    Exploration Strategy & State Representation:
    1. If you see a closed door, use (has-door) and (door-is-closed). Do NOT use (connected).
    2. When an action reveals a new location (e.g., "revealing the laundry room"), you MUST update the PF to include the new location object AND the (connected ...) facts for both directions.
    
    Goal Setting (Must be grounded, e.g., (at room_x), no variables or quantifiers):
    - Priority 1: Information Gathering. If there are closed doors at the current location, the goal should be to open one:
      (:goal (door-is-open ?current_loc ?unexplored_dir))
    - Priority 2: Movement. If paths are open and connections known, the goal should be to move to an unvisited location:
      (:goal (at ?unvisited_location))

    Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status.

This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations:

    Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
    The format should strictly be:
        {
        "df": "...",
        "pf": "..."
        }

    You are in a partially observable environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files based ONLY on your observations. 
    Do not invent information. Crucially, you do NOT know where a closed door leads until you open it.

    Here are your current observations: Action: move west
You are in the backyard. Through an open screen door, to the North you see the living room. To the East you see the street. Through an open patio door, to the West you see the corridor. 

Action: move west
You are in the corridor. Through an open wood door, to the North you see the bathroom. To the South you see the driveway. Through an open patio door, to the East you see the backyard. To the West you see a closed wood door. 

Action: open door to west
You open the wood door, revealing the bedroom. 

    Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to east', 'close door to north', 'close door to west', 'move east', 'move north', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to east', 'open door to north', 'open door to west']

    You must generate the DF and PF strictly following these action schemas:
    1. :action open-door
        :parameters (?loc - location ?dir - direction)
        ;; Used for discovery. Does NOT require knowing the destination.
    2. :action move
        :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
        ;; Requires known connection and open path.

    Key Predicates (must be defined in DF and used in PF):
    - (at ?loc)
    - (has-door ?loc ?dir): A door exists at ?loc in ?dir.
    - (door-is-closed ?loc ?dir) / (door-is-open ?loc ?dir): State of the door.
    - (connected ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir): Connection knowledge discovered AFTER opening a door or observing an open passage.

    Exploration Strategy & State Representation:
    1. If you see a closed door, use (has-door) and (door-is-closed). Do NOT use (connected).
    2. When an action reveals a new location (e.g., "revealing the laundry room"), you MUST update the PF to include the new location object AND the (connected ...) facts for both directions.
    
    Goal Setting (Must be grounded, e.g., (at room_x), no variables or quantifiers):
    - Priority 1: Information Gathering. If there are closed doors at the current location, the goal should be to open one:
      (:goal (door-is-open ?current_loc ?unexplored_dir))
    - Priority 2: Movement. If paths are open and connections known, the goal should be to move to an unvisited location:
      (:goal (at ?unvisited_location))

    Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status.

> move east 
 You are in the corridor. In one part of the room you see a key holder, that has nothing on it. There is also a shoe cabinet that is closed. You also see a umbrella stand, that has nothing on it. In another part of the room you see a hat rack, that has nothing on it. In one part of the room you see a coat hanger, that has nothing on it. 
Through an open wood door, to the North you see the bathroom. To the South you see the driveway. Through an open patio door, to the East you see the backyard. Through an open wood door, to the West you see the bedroom.

--Small Loop--: 0 
Prompt: 
    Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
    The format should strictly be:
        {
        "df": "...",
        "pf": "..."
        }

    You are in a partially observable environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files based ONLY on your observations. 
    Do not invent information. Crucially, you do NOT know where a closed door leads until you open it.

    Here are your current observations: Action: move east
You are in the corridor. Through an open wood door, to the North you see the bathroom. To the South you see the driveway. Through an open patio door, to the East you see the backyard. Through an open wood door, to the West you see the bedroom. 

    Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to east', 'close door to north', 'close door to west', 'move east', 'move north', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to east', 'open door to north', 'open door to west']

    You must generate the DF and PF strictly following these action schemas:
    1. :action open-door
        :parameters (?loc - location ?dir - direction)
        ;; Used for discovery. Does NOT require knowing the destination.
    2. :action move
        :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
        ;; Requires known connection and open path.

    Key Predicates (must be defined in DF and used in PF):
    - (at ?loc)
    - (has-door ?loc ?dir): A door exists at ?loc in ?dir.
    - (door-is-closed ?loc ?dir) / (door-is-open ?loc ?dir): State of the door.
    - (connected ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir): Connection knowledge discovered AFTER opening a door or observing an open passage.

    Exploration Strategy & State Representation:
    1. If you see a closed door, use (has-door) and (door-is-closed). Do NOT use (connected).
    2. When an action reveals a new location (e.g., "revealing the laundry room"), you MUST update the PF to include the new location object AND the (connected ...) facts for both directions.
    
    Goal Setting (Must be grounded, e.g., (at room_x), no variables or quantifiers):
    - Priority 1: Information Gathering. If there are closed doors at the current location, the goal should be to open one:
      (:goal (door-is-open ?current_loc ?unexplored_dir))
    - Priority 2: Movement. If paths are open and connections known, the goal should be to move to an unvisited location:
      (:goal (at ?unvisited_location))

    Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status.
