Prompt: 
    Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
    The format should strictly be:
        {
        "df": "...",
        "pf": "..."
        }

    You are in a partially observable environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files based ONLY on your observations. 
    Do not invent information. Crucially, you do NOT know where a closed door leads until you open it.

    Here are your current observations: Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the South you see a closed frosted-glass door. To the West you see the corridor. 

    Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to south', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to south']

    You must generate the DF and PF strictly following these action schemas:
    1. :action open-door
        :parameters (?loc - location ?dir - direction)
        ;; Used for discovery. Does NOT require knowing the destination.
    2. :action move
        :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
        ;; Requires known connection and open path.

    Key Predicates (must be defined in DF and used in PF):
    - (at ?loc)
    - (has-door ?loc ?dir): A door exists at ?loc in ?dir.
    - (door-is-closed ?loc ?dir) / (door-is-open ?loc ?dir): State of the door.
    - (connected ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir): Connection knowledge discovered AFTER opening a door or observing an open passage.

    Exploration Strategy & State Representation:
    1. If you see a closed door, use (has-door) and (door-is-closed). Do NOT use (connected).
    2. When an action reveals a new location (e.g., "revealing the laundry room"), you MUST update the PF to include the new location object AND the (connected ...) facts for both directions.
    
    Goal Setting (Must be grounded, e.g., (at room_x), no variables or quantifiers):
    - Priority 1: Information Gathering. If there are closed doors at the current location, the goal should be to open one:
      (:goal (door-is-open ?current_loc ?unexplored_dir))
    - Priority 2: Movement. If paths are open and connections known, the goal should be to move to an unvisited location:
      (:goal (at ?unvisited_location))

    Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status.

    Exploration Strategy & State Representation:
    1. If you see a closed door, use (has-door) and (door-is-closed). Do NOT use (connected).
    2. When an action reveals a new location (e.g., "revealing the laundry room"), you MUST update the PF to include the new location object AND the (connected ...) facts for both directions.
    
    Goal Setting (Must be grounded, e.g., (at room_x), no variables or quantifiers):
    - Priority 1: Information Gathering. If there are closed doors at the current location, the goal should be to open one:
      (:goal (door-is-open ?current_loc ?unexplored_dir))
    - Priority 2: Movement. If paths are open and connections known, the goal should be to move to an unvisited location:
      (:goal (at ?unvisited_location))

    Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status.

    Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to south', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to south']

    You must generate the DF and PF strictly following these action schemas:
    1. :action open-door
        :parameters (?loc - location ?dir - direction)
        ;; Used for discovery. Does NOT require knowing the destination.
    2. :action move
        :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
        ;; Requires known connection and open path.

    Key Predicates (must be defined in DF and used in PF):
    - (at ?loc)
    - (has-door ?loc ?dir): A door exists at ?loc in ?dir.
    - (door-is-closed ?loc ?dir) / (door-is-open ?loc ?dir): State of the door.
    - (connected ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir): Connection knowledge discovered AFTER opening a door or observing an open passage.

    Exploration Strategy & State Representation:
    1. If you see a closed door, use (has-door) and (door-is-closed). Do NOT use (connected).
    2. When an action reveals a new location (e.g., "revealing the laundry room"), you MUST update the PF to include the new location object AND the (connected ...) facts for both directions.
    
    Goal Setting (Must be grounded, e.g., (at room_x), no variables or quantifiers):
    - Priority 1: Information Gathering. If there are closed doors at the current location, the goal should be to open one:
      (:goal (door-is-open ?current_loc ?unexplored_dir))
    - Priority 2: Movement. If paths are open and connections known, the goal should be to move to an unvisited location:
      (:goal (at ?unvisited_location))

    Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status.

This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations: 
Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the South you see a closed frosted-glass door. To the West you see the corridor. 
Action: open door to south
You open the frosted-glass door, revealing the pantry. 
Action: move south
You are in the pantry. Through an open frosted-glass door, to the North you see the kitchen. 
Action: move north
You are in the kitchen. Through an open frosted-glass door, to the South you see the pantry. To the West you see the corridor.

)

You made some mistakes when generating those files. Here is the error message: 
ff: goal can be simplified to FALSE. No plan will solve it

You are repeating the same sequence of actions for at least three times. You may stuck in one location or have the wrong goal.
You should revise your problem file to avoid the repeat.
Remember your goal is always to keep exploration: this means prioritizing opening closed doors (information gathering goal) or moving to unvisited known locations (movement goal). Ensure your goal reflects this intent.

Now rewrite both the domain and problem files with the minimal fix.

You should revise your problem file to avoid the repeat.
Remember your goal is always to keep exploration: this means prioritizing opening closed doors (information gathering goal) or moving to unvisited known locations (movement goal). Ensure your goal reflects this intent.

Now rewrite both the domain and problem files with the minimal fix.

    Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
    The format should strictly be:
        {
        "df": "...",
        "pf": "..."
        }

    You are in a partially observable environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files based ONLY on your observations. 
    Do not invent information. Crucially, you do NOT know where a closed door leads until you open it.

    Here are your current observations: Action: open door to west
Unknown action: I'm not sure what you mean.

    Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to south', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to south']

    You must generate the DF and PF strictly following these action schemas:
    1. :action open-door
        :parameters (?loc - location ?dir - direction)
        ;; Used for discovery. Does NOT require knowing the destination.
    2. :action move
        :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
        ;; Requires known connection and open path.

    Key Predicates (must be defined in DF and used in PF):
    - (at ?loc)
    - (has-door ?loc ?dir): A door exists at ?loc in ?dir.
    - (door-is-closed ?loc ?dir) / (door-is-open ?loc ?dir): State of the door.
    - (connected ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir): Connection knowledge discovered AFTER opening a door or observing an open passage.

    Exploration Strategy & State Representation:
    1. If you see a closed door, use (has-door) and (door-is-closed). Do NOT use (connected).
    2. When an action reveals a new location (e.g., "revealing the laundry room"), you MUST update the PF to include the new location object AND the (connected ...) facts for both directions.
    
    Goal Setting (Must be grounded, e.g., (at room_x), no variables or quantifiers):
    - Priority 1: Information Gathering. If there are closed doors at the current location, the goal should be to open one:
      (:goal (door-is-open ?current_loc ?unexplored_dir))
    - Priority 2: Movement. If paths are open and connections known, the goal should be to move to an unvisited location:
      (:goal (at ?unvisited_location))

    Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status.

This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations: 
Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the South you see a closed frosted-glass door. To the West you see the corridor. 
Action: open door to south
You open the frosted-glass door, revealing the pantry. 
Action: move south
You are in the pantry. Through an open frosted-glass door, to the North you see the kitchen. 
Action: move north

    - (connected ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir): Connection knowledge discovered AFTER opening a door or observing an open passage.

    Exploration Strategy & State Representation:
    1. If you see a closed door, use (has-door) and (door-is-closed). Do NOT use (connected).
    2. When an action reveals a new location (e.g., "revealing the laundry room"), you MUST update the PF to include the new location object AND the (connected ...) facts for both directions.
    
    Goal Setting (Must be grounded, e.g., (at room_x), no variables or quantifiers):
    - Priority 1: Information Gathering. If there are closed doors at the current location, the goal should be to open one:
      (:goal (door-is-open ?current_loc ?unexplored_dir))
    - Priority 2: Movement. If paths are open and connections known, the goal should be to move to an unvisited location:
      (:goal (at ?unvisited_location))

    Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status.

This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations: 
Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the South you see a closed frosted-glass door. To the West you see the corridor. 
Action: open door to south

    The format should strictly be:

    Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to south', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to south']

    You must generate the DF and PF strictly following these action schemas:

    2. :action move

        ;; Requires known connection and open path.

    Key Predicates (must be defined in DF and used in PF):
    - (at ?loc)
    - (has-door ?loc ?dir): A door exists at ?loc in ?dir.
    - (door-is-closed ?loc ?dir) / (door-is-open ?loc ?dir): State of the door.

Raw plan text:  
--Small Loop--: 1 
Prompt: 
    Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
    The format should strictly be:
        {
        "df": "...",
        "pf": "..."
        }

    You are in a partially observable environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files based ONLY on your observations. 
    Do not invent information. Crucially, you do NOT know where a closed door leads until you open it.

    Here are your current observations: Action: move north
You are in the kitchen. Through an open frosted-glass door, to the South you see the pantry. To the West you see the corridor. 

    Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to south', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to south']

    You must generate the DF and PF strictly following these action schemas:
    1. :action open-door
        :parameters (?loc - location ?dir - direction)
        ;; Used for discovery. Does NOT require knowing the destination.
    2. :action move
        :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
        ;; Requires known connection and open path.

    Key Predicates (must be defined in DF and used in PF):
    - (at ?loc)
    - (has-door ?loc ?dir): A door exists at ?loc in ?dir.
    - (door-is-closed ?loc ?dir) / (door-is-open ?loc ?dir): State of the door.
    - (connected ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir): Connection knowledge discovered AFTER opening a door or observing an open passage.

    Exploration Strategy & State Representation:
    1. If you see a closed door, use (has-door) and (door-is-closed). Do NOT use (connected).
    2. When an action reveals a new location (e.g., "revealing the laundry room"), you MUST update the PF to include the new location object AND the (connected ...) facts for both directions.
    
    Goal Setting (Must be grounded, e.g., (at room_x), no variables or quantifiers):
    - Priority 1: Information Gathering. If there are closed doors at the current location, the goal should be to open one:
      (:goal (door-is-open ?current_loc ?unexplored_dir))
    - Priority 2: Movement. If paths are open and connections known, the goal should be to move to an unvisited location:
      (:goal (at ?unvisited_location))

    Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status.

This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations: 
Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the South you see a closed frosted-glass door. To the West you see the corridor. 
Action: open door to south
You open the frosted-glass door, revealing the pantry. 
Action: move south
You are in the pantry. Through an open frosted-glass door, to the North you see the kitchen. 
Action: move north
You are in the kitchen. Through an open frosted-glass door, to the South you see the pantry. To the West you see the corridor.

Prompt: 
    Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
    The format should strictly be:
        {
        "df": "...",
        "pf": "..."
        }

    You are in a partially observable environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files based ONLY on your observations. 
    Do not invent information. Crucially, you do NOT know where a closed door leads until you open it.

    Here are your current observations: Action: open door to west
Unknown action: I'm not sure what you mean.

    Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to south', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to south']

    You must generate the DF and PF strictly following these action schemas:
    1. :action open-door
        :parameters (?loc - location ?dir - direction)
        ;; Used for discovery. Does NOT require knowing the destination.
    2. :action move
        :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
        ;; Requires known connection and open path.

    Key Predicates (must be defined in DF and used in PF):
    - (at ?loc)
    - (has-door ?loc ?dir): A door exists at ?loc in ?dir.
    - (door-is-closed ?loc ?dir) / (door-is-open ?loc ?dir): State of the door.
    - (connected ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir): Connection knowledge discovered AFTER opening a door or observing an open passage.

    Exploration Strategy & State Representation:
    1. If you see a closed door, use (has-door) and (door-is-closed). Do NOT use (connected).
    2. When an action reveals a new location (e.g., "revealing the laundry room"), you MUST update the PF to include the new location object AND the (connected ...) facts for both directions.
    
    Goal Setting (Must be grounded, e.g., (at room_x), no variables or quantifiers):
    - Priority 1: Information Gathering. If there are closed doors at the current location, the goal should be to open one:
      (:goal (door-is-open ?current_loc ?unexplored_dir))
    - Priority 2: Movement. If paths are open and connections known, the goal should be to move to an unvisited location:
      (:goal (at ?unvisited_location))

    Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status.

This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations: 
Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the South you see a closed frosted-glass door. To the West you see the corridor. 
Action: open door to south
You open the frosted-glass door, revealing the pantry. 
Action: move south
You are in the pantry. Through an open frosted-glass door, to the North you see the kitchen.
