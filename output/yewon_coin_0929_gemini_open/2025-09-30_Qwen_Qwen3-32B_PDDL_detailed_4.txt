    Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
    The format should strictly be:
        {
        "df": "...",
        "pf": "..."
        }

    You are in a partially observable environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files based ONLY on your observations. 
    Do not invent information. Crucially, you do NOT know where a closed door leads until you open it.

    Here are your current observations: Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see a closed sliding patio door. To the South you see a closed wood door. To the East you see a closed frosted-glass door. To the West you see the corridor. 

    Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to east', 'close door to north', 'close door to south', 'move east', 'move north', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to east', 'open door to north', 'open door to south']

    You must generate the DF and PF strictly following these action schemas:
    1. :action open-door
        :parameters (?loc - location ?dir - direction)
        ;; Used for discovery. Does NOT require knowing the destination.
    2. :action move
        :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
        ;; Requires known connection and open path.

    Key Predicates (must be defined in DF and used in PF):
    - (at ?loc)
    - (has-door ?loc ?dir): A door exists at ?loc in ?dir.
    - (door-is-closed ?loc ?dir) / (door-is-open ?loc ?dir): State of the door.
    - (connected ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir): Connection knowledge discovered AFTER opening a door or observing an open passage.

    Exploration Strategy & State Representation:
    1. If you see a closed door, use (has-door) and (door-is-closed). Do NOT use (connected).
    2. When an action reveals a new location (e.g., "revealing the laundry room"), you MUST update the PF to include the new location object AND the (connected ...) facts for both directions.
    
    Goal Setting (Must be grounded, e.g., (at room_x), no variables or quantifiers):
    - Priority 1: Information Gathering. If there are closed doors at the current location, the goal should be to open one:
      (:goal (door-is-open ?current_loc ?unexplored_dir))
    - Priority 2: Movement. If paths are open and connections known, the goal should be to move to an unvisited location:
      (:goal (at ?unvisited_location))

Prompt: 
    Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
    The format should strictly be:
        {
        "df": "...",
        "pf": "..."
        }

    You are in a partially observable environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files based ONLY on your observations. 
    Do not invent information. Crucially, you do NOT know where a closed door leads until you open it.

    Here are your current observations: Action: move east
You are in the pantry. Through an open frosted-glass door, to the West you see the kitchen. 

    Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to west', 'move west', 'open door to west']

    You must generate the DF and PF strictly following these action schemas:
    1. :action open-door
        :parameters (?loc - location ?dir - direction)
        ;; Used for discovery. Does NOT require knowing the destination.
    2. :action move
        :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
        ;; Requires known connection and open path.

    Key Predicates (must be defined in DF and used in PF):
    - (at ?loc)
    - (has-door ?loc ?dir): A door exists at ?loc in ?dir.
    - (door-is-closed ?loc ?dir) / (door-is-open ?loc ?dir): State of the door.
    - (connected ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir): Connection knowledge discovered AFTER opening a door or observing an open passage.

    Exploration Strategy & State Representation:
    1. If you see a closed door, use (has-door) and (door-is-closed). Do NOT use (connected).
    2. When an action reveals a new location (e.g., "revealing the laundry room"), you MUST update the PF to include the new location object AND the (connected ...) facts for both directions.
    
    Goal Setting (Must be grounded, e.g., (at room_x), no variables or quantifiers):
    - Priority 1: Information Gathering. If there are closed doors at the current location, the goal should be to open one:
      (:goal (door-is-open ?current_loc ?unexplored_dir))
    - Priority 2: Movement. If paths are open and connections known, the goal should be to move to an unvisited location:
      (:goal (at ?unvisited_location))

    Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status.

This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations: 
Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see a closed sliding patio door. To the South you see a closed wood door. To the East you see a closed frosted-glass door. To the West you see the corridor. 
Action: open door to south
You open the wood door, revealing the laundry room. 
Action: open door to north
You open the sliding patio door, revealing the backyard. 
Action: open door to east
You open the frosted-glass door, revealing the pantry. 
Action: move east
You are in the pantry. Through an open frosted-glass door, to the West you see the kitchen. 

You have already generated df and pf files according to the observations.

    Do not invent information. Crucially, you do NOT know where a closed door leads until you open it.

    Here are your current observations: Action: open door to north
You open the wood door, revealing the bathroom. 

    Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to north', 'close door to west', 'move east', 'move north', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to north', 'open door to west']

    You must generate the DF and PF strictly following these action schemas:
    1. :action open-door
        :parameters (?loc - location ?dir - direction)
        ;; Used for discovery. Does NOT require knowing the destination.
    2. :action move
        :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
        ;; Requires known connection and open path.

    Key Predicates (must be defined in DF and used in PF):
    - (at ?loc)
    - (has-door ?loc ?dir): A door exists at ?loc in ?dir.
    - (door-is-closed ?loc ?dir) / (door-is-open ?loc ?dir): State of the door.
    - (connected ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir): Connection knowledge discovered AFTER opening a door or observing an open passage.

    Exploration Strategy & State Representation:
    1. If you see a closed door, use (has-door) and (door-is-closed). Do NOT use (connected).
    2. When an action reveals a new location (e.g., "revealing the laundry room"), you MUST update the PF to include the new location object AND the (connected ...) facts for both directions.
    
    Goal Setting (Must be grounded, e.g., (at room_x), no variables or quantifiers):
    - Priority 1: Information Gathering. If there are closed doors at the current location, the goal should be to open one:
      (:goal (door-is-open ?current_loc ?unexplored_dir))
    - Priority 2: Movement. If paths are open and connections known, the goal should be to move to an unvisited location:
      (:goal (at ?unvisited_location))

    Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status.

This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations: 
Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see a closed sliding patio door. To the South you see a closed wood door. To the East you see a closed frosted-glass door. To the West you see the corridor. 
Action: open door to south
You open the wood door, revealing the laundry room. 
Action: open door to north
You open the sliding patio door, revealing the backyard. 
Action: open door to east
You open the frosted-glass door, revealing the pantry. 
Action: move east
You are in the pantry. Through an open frosted-glass door, to the West you see the kitchen. 
Action: move west
You are in the kitchen. Through an open sliding patio door, to the North you see the backyard. Through an open wood door, to the South you see the laundry room. Through an open frosted-glass door, to the East you see the pantry. To the West you see the corridor. 
Action: move west
You are in the corridor. To the North you see a closed wood door. To the South you see the driveway. To the East you see the kitchen. To the West you see a closed wood door. 
Action: open door to north
You open the wood door, revealing the bathroom.

Prompt: 
    Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
    The format should strictly be:
        {
        "df": "...",
        "pf": "..."
        }

    You are in a partially observable environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files based ONLY on your observations. 
    Do not invent information. Crucially, you do NOT know where a closed door leads until you open it.

    Here are your current observations: Action: open door to north
You open the wood door, revealing the living room. 

    Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to east', 'close door to north', 'move east', 'move north', 'open door to east', 'open door to north']

    You must generate the DF and PF strictly following these action schemas:
    1. :action open-door
        :parameters (?loc - location ?dir - direction)
        ;; Used for discovery. Does NOT require knowing the destination.
    2. :action move
        :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
        ;; Requires known connection and open path.

    Key Predicates (must be defined in DF and used in PF):
    - (at ?loc)
    - (has-door ?loc ?dir): A door exists at ?loc in ?dir.
    - (door-is-closed ?loc ?dir) / (door-is-open ?loc ?dir): State of the door.
    - (connected ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir): Connection knowledge discovered AFTER opening a door or observing an open passage.

    Exploration Strategy & State Representation:
    1. If you see a closed door, use (has-door) and (door-is-closed). Do NOT use (connected).
    2. When an action reveals a new location (e.g., "revealing the laundry room"), you MUST update the PF to include the new location object AND the (connected ...) facts for both directions.
    
    Goal Setting (Must be grounded, e.g., (at room_x), no variables or quantifiers):
    - Priority 1: Information Gathering. If there are closed doors at the current location, the goal should be to open one:
      (:goal (door-is-open ?current_loc ?unexplored_dir))
    - Priority 2: Movement. If paths are open and connections known, the goal should be to move to an unvisited location:
      (:goal (at ?unvisited_location))

    Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status.

This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations: 
Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see a closed sliding patio door. To the South you see a closed wood door. To the East you see a closed frosted-glass door. To the West you see the corridor. 
Action: open door to south
You open the wood door, revealing the laundry room. 
Action: open door to north
You open the sliding patio door, revealing the backyard. 
Action: open door to east
You open the frosted-glass door, revealing the pantry. 
Action: move east
You are in the pantry. Through an open frosted-glass door, to the West you see the kitchen. 
Action: move west
You are in the kitchen. Through an open sliding patio door, to the North you see the backyard. Through an open wood door, to the South you see the laundry room. Through an open frosted-glass door, to the East you see the pantry. To the West you see the corridor. 
Action: move west
You are in the corridor. To the North you see a closed wood door. To the South you see the driveway. To the East you see the kitchen. To the West you see a closed wood door. 
Action: open door to north
You open the wood door, revealing the bathroom. 
Action: open door to west
You open the wood door, revealing the bedroom. 
Action: move west
You are in the bedroom. To the North you see a closed wood door. Through an open wood door, to the East you see the corridor. 
Action: open door to north
You open the wood door, revealing the living room. 

You have already generated df and pf files according to the observations.
