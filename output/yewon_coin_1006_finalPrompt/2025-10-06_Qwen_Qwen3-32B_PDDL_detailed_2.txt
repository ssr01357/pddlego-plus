You are in a partially observable environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.

Prompt: 
    Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
    The format should strictly be:
        {
        "df": "...",
        "pf": "..."
        }


You are in a partially observable environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
Here are your current observations: Action: move north
Unknown action: I'm not sure what you mean.

Here are some valid actions you can take: ['move east', 'move north', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to east', 'open door to north', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']
You should generate df and pf that strictly follow these action schemas. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:
1. :action open-door
    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
2. :action move
    :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
You should have a goal in the problem file like this: 
(:goal 
    (at ?location)
) 


Note: 
- In problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status.
- In problem file's goal, ?location must be grounded, no variables or quantifiers.


This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations: 
Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see the living room. To the South you see a closed wood door. To the East you see a closed frosted-glass door. To the West you see a closed sliding patio door. 
Action: move north
You are in the living room. To the South you see the kitchen. To the East you see a closed wood door. To the West you see the corridor. 


You have already generated df and pf files according to the observations.
This is previous domain file: 
(define (domain exploration)
  (:requirements :strips :typing)
  (:types location direction)
  (:constants north south east west - direction)
  (:predicates (at ?loc - location) (closed ?loc - location ?dir - direction) (connected ?from - location ?dir - direction ?to - location))
  (:action open-door
    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
    :precondition (and (at ?loc1) (closed ?loc1 ?dir))
    :effect (not (closed ?loc1 ?dir)))
  (:action move
    :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
    :precondition (and (at ?from) (not (closed ?from ?dir)) (connected ?from ?dir ?to))
    :effect (and (not (at ?from)) (at ?to)))
)

This is previous problem file: 
(define (problem exploration-problem)
  (:domain exploration)
  (:objects
    kitchen - location
    living-room - location
    corridor - location
    south-room - location
    east-room - location
    west-room - location
    north south east west - direction
  )
  (:init
    (at kitchen)
    (closed kitchen south)
    (closed kitchen east)
    (closed kitchen west)
    (closed living-room east)
    (connected kitchen north living-room)
    (connected living-room south kitchen)
    (connected living-room west corridor)
  )
  (:goal (at corridor))
)


Based on the df and pf that you generated, the external solver could generate a plan but after simulating in the game environment, it caused those errors: 
This is the action you take: move north. You cannot move to that direction.


Now rewrite both the domain and problem files with the minimal fix.

Based on the df and pf that you generated, the external solver could generate a plan but after simulating in the game environment, it caused those errors: 
This is the action you take: move north. You cannot move to that direction.


You are repeating the same sequence of actions for at least three times. You may stuck in one location or have the wrong goal.
You should revise your problem file to avoid the repeat.
Remember your goal is always to keep exploration: this means prioritizing opening closed doors and moving to unvisited known locations. Ensure your goal reflects this intent.
