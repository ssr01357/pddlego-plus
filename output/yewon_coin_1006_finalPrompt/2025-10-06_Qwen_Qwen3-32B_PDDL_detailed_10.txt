You are in a partially observable environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
Here are your current observations: Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the South you see a closed plain door. To the West you see the corridor. 

Here are some valid actions you can take: ['move east', 'move north', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to east', 'open door to north', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']
You should generate df and pf that strictly follow these action schemas. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:
1. :action open-door
    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
2. :action move

You should have a goal in the problem file like this:

Note: 
- In problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status.

 You are in the bedroom. In one part of the room you see a dressing table, that has nothing on it. There is also a desk chair, that has nothing on it. You also see a desk, that has nothing on it. In another part of the room you see a chest of drawers that is closed. In one part of the room you see a wardrobe that is closed. There is also a night stand, that has nothing on it. You also see a bed, that has nothing on it. 
To the East you see the bathroom.

You are in a partially observable environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
Here are your current observations: Action: move west
You are in the bedroom. To the East you see the bathroom. 

Here are some valid actions you can take: ['move east', 'move north', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to east', 'open door to north', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']
You should generate df and pf that strictly follow these action schemas. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:
1. :action open-door
    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
2. :action move
    :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
You should have a goal in the problem file like this:

Note: 
- In problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status.
- In problem file's goal, ?location must be grounded, no variables or quantifiers.


This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations: 
Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the South you see a closed plain door. To the West you see the corridor. 
Action: move west
You are in the corridor. To the North you see a closed wood door. To the South you see a closed sliding patio door. To the East you see the kitchen. To the West you see the living room. 
Action: move west
You are in the living room. To the North you see a closed wood door. To the East you see the corridor. 
Action: open door to north

    Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
    The format should strictly be:

        }


You are in a partially observable environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
Here are your current observations: Action: move east
You are in the bathroom. Through an open wood door, to the South you see the living room. To the East you see a closed wood door. To the West you see the bedroom. 

Action: move south
You are in the living room. Through an open wood door, to the North you see the bathroom. To the East you see the corridor. 

Action: move south
Unknown action: I'm not sure what you mean.

Here are some valid actions you can take: ['move east', 'move north', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to east', 'open door to north', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']
You should generate df and pf that strictly follow these action schemas. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:
1. :action open-door

2. :action move

You should have a goal in the problem file like this:

Note: 
- In problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status.
- In problem file's goal, ?location must be grounded, no variables or quantifiers.


This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations:

Based on the df and pf that you generated, the external solver could generate a plan but after simulating in the game environment, it caused those errors: 
This is the action you take: move south. You cannot move to that direction.


You are repeating the same sequence of actions for at least three times. You may stuck in one location or have the wrong goal.
You should revise your problem file to avoid the repeat.
Remember your goal is always to keep exploration: this means prioritizing opening closed doors and moving to unvisited known locations. Ensure your goal reflects this intent.


Now rewrite both the domain and problem files with the minimal fix.

Based on the df and pf that you generated, the external solver could generate a plan but after simulating in the game environment, it caused those errors: 
This is the action you take: move east. You cannot move to that direction.

You are in a partially observable environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.

You should have a goal in the problem file like this: 
(:goal 
    (at ?location)
) 


Note: 
- In problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status.
- In problem file's goal, ?location must be grounded, no variables or quantifiers.


This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations: 
Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the South you see a closed plain door. To the West you see the corridor. 
Action: move west
You are in the corridor. To the North you see a closed wood door. To the South you see a closed sliding patio door. To the East you see the kitchen. To the West you see the living room. 
Action: move west
You are in the living room. To the North you see a closed wood door. To the East you see the corridor. 
Action: open door to north
You open the wood door, revealing the bathroom. 
Action: move north

You have already generated df and pf files according to the observations.

Based on the df and pf that you generated, the external solver could generate a plan but after simulating in the game environment, it caused those errors: 
This is the action you take: open door to south. You try to open a door that is already open. You already visited here. Make sure the status of door is correct.


Now rewrite both the domain and problem files with the minimal fix.
