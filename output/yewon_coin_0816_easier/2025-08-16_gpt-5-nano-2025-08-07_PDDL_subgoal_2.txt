Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
The format should strictly be:
    {
    "df": "...",
    "pf": "..."
    }


You are in an environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
Here are your current observations: Action: move west
You are in the backyard. Through an open patio door, to the North you see the kitchen. To the South you see the driveway. To the East you see the street. To the West you see a closed patio door. 

Action: open door to west
You open the patio door, revealing the living room. 

Action: move west
You are in the living room. To the South you see a closed wood door. Through an open patio door, to the East you see the backyard. 

Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to south', 'close door to west', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to south', 'open door to west', 'take toaster']
You should generate df and pf strictly follow these valid actions. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:
1. :action open-door
    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
2. :action move
    :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
You should have a goal in the problem file like this: 
(:goal 
    (at ?location)
) where location should be somewhere not visited
Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status


This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations: 
Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the South you see a closed patio door. To the West you see a closed plain door. 
Action: open door to south
You open the patio door, revealing the backyard. 
Action: move south
You are in the backyard. Through an open patio door, to the North you see the kitchen. To the South you see the driveway. To the East you see the street. To the West you see a closed patio door.

Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
The format should strictly be:

    }


You are in an environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
Here are your current observations: Action: open door to south
You open the wood door, revealing the bathroom. 

Action: move south
You are in the bathroom. Through an open wood door, to the North you see the living room. To the South you see a closed wood door. To the West you see a closed wood door. 

Action: open door to west
You open the wood door, revealing the corridor. 

Action: move west
You are in the corridor. Through an open wood door, to the East you see the bathroom. To the West you see a closed wood door. 

Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to south', 'close door to west', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to south', 'open door to west', 'take toaster']
You should generate df and pf strictly follow these valid actions. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:
1. :action open-door
    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
2. :action move
    :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
You should have a goal in the problem file like this: 
(:goal 
    (at ?location)
) where location should be somewhere not visited
Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status


This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations: 
Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the South you see a closed patio door. To the West you see a closed plain door. 
Action: open door to south
You open the patio door, revealing the backyard. 
Action: move south

--Small Loop--: 5 
Prompt: 
Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
The format should strictly be:
    {
    "df": "...",
    "pf": "..."
    }


You are in an environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
Here are your current observations: Action: move east
You are in the bathroom. Through an open wood door, to the North you see the living room. To the South you see a closed wood door. Through an open wood door, to the West you see the corridor. 

Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to south', 'close door to west', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to south', 'open door to west', 'take toaster']
You should generate df and pf strictly follow these valid actions. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:
1. :action open-door
    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
2. :action move
    :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
You should have a goal in the problem file like this: 
(:goal 
    (at ?location)
) where location should be somewhere not visited
Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status


This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations: 
Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the South you see a closed patio door. To the West you see a closed plain door. 
Action: open door to south
You open the patio door, revealing the backyard. 
Action: move south
You are in the backyard. Through an open patio door, to the North you see the kitchen. To the South you see the driveway. To the East you see the street. To the West you see a closed patio door. 
Action: move south
You are in the driveway. To the North you see the backyard. 
Action: move north
You are in the backyard. Through an open patio door, to the North you see the kitchen. To the South you see the driveway. To the East you see the street. To the West you see a closed patio door. 
Action: move east
You are in the street. To the North you see a closed sliding door. To the West you see the backyard. 
Action: move west
You are in the backyard. Through an open patio door, to the North you see the kitchen. To the South you see the driveway. To the East you see the street. To the West you see a closed patio door. 
Action: open door to west
You open the patio door, revealing the living room. 
Action: move west
You are in the living room. To the South you see a closed wood door. Through an open patio door, to the East you see the backyard. 
Action: open door to south
You open the wood door, revealing the bathroom. 
Action: move south
You are in the bathroom. Through an open wood door, to the North you see the living room. To the South you see a closed wood door. To the West you see a closed wood door. 
Action: open door to west
You open the wood door, revealing the corridor. 
Action: move west
You are in the corridor. Through an open wood door, to the East you see the bathroom. To the West you see a closed wood door. 
Action: move east
You are in the bathroom. Through an open wood door, to the North you see the living room. To the South you see a closed wood door. Through an open wood door, to the West you see the corridor. 


You have already generate df and pf files according to the observations.
This is previous domain file: 
(define (domain exploration)\n  (:requirements :typing)\n  (:types location direction)\n  (:constants kitchen backyard driveway street living_room bathroom corridor - location\n              north south east west - direction)\n  (:predicates\n    (at ?l - location)\n    (door ?l1 ?l2 - location ?dir - direction)\n    (opened ?l1 ?l2 - location ?dir - direction)\n    (closed ?l1 ?l2 - location ?dir - direction)\n  )\n  (:action open-door\n    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)\n    :precondition (and (at ?loc1) (door ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir) (closed ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir))\n    :effect (and (not (closed ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir)) (opened ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir))\n  )\n  (:action move\n    :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)\n    :precondition (and (at ?from) (opened ?from ?to ?dir))\n    :effect (and (not (at ?from)) (at ?to))\n  )\n)\n

This is previous problem file: 
(define (problem explore-bathroom)\n  (:domain exploration)\n  (:init\n    (at bathroom)\n    (door bathroom living_room north)\n    (opened bathroom living_room north)\n    (door living_room bathroom south)\n    (opened living_room bathroom south)\n    (door bathroom corridor west)\n    (opened bathroom corridor west)\n    (door corridor bathroom east)\n    (opened corridor bathroom east)\n  )\n  (:goal (at corridor))\n)\n


You made some mistakes when generating those files. Here is the error message: 
                    ── SOLVER LOG ─────────────────────────────────
                    /tmp/pddl_run_pq2o4hx4/domain.pddl: syntax error in line 1, 'N':

                    ── VAL LOG ────────────────────────────────────
                    No validation log.


Now rewrite both the domain and problem files with the minimal fix.
