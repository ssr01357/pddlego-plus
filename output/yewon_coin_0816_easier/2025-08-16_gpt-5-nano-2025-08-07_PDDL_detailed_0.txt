Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.

Action: move south
You are in the bathroom. Through an open wood door, to the North you see the living room. To the South you see a closed wood door. To the West you see a closed wood door. 

Action: open door to west
You open the wood door, revealing the corridor. 

Action: move west
You are in the corridor. Through an open wood door, to the East you see the bathroom. To the West you see a closed wood door.

Based on the df and pf that you generated, the external solver could generate actions but after simulating in the game environment, it caused those errors: 
Unknown action: I'm not sure what you mean. 

You made some mistakes when generating those files. Here is the error message: 
── SOLVER LOG ─────────────────────────────────
ff: goal can be simplified to FALSE. No plan will solve it
── VAL LOG ────────────────────────────────────
No validation log.


You are repeating the same sequence of actions for at least three times. You may stuck in one location or have the wrong goal.
You should revise your problem file to avoid the repeat.
Remember your goal is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet, i.e. your goal should be go to other not visited location but shouldn't be at one fixed location.

Now rewrite both the domain and problem files with the minimal fix.
