        The output format should be: {"df": "...", "pf": "..."}
    
        You are in an environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
        Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
        Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
        Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
        In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
        If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
        Here are your current observations: Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the South you see a closed patio door. To the West you see a closed plain door. 

        Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to south', 'close door to west', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']
        You should generate df and pf strictly follow this valid actions. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:
        1. :action open-door
            :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
        2. :action move
            :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
        You should have a goal in the problem file like this: 
        (:goal 
            (at ?location)
        ) where location should be somewhere not visited
        Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status
    
        This is previous domain file: (define (domain explore)
    (:requirements :strips :typing)
    (:types location direction)

    (:predicates
        (at ?loc - location)
        (door ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir - direction)
        (door-open ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir - direction)
    )

    (:action open-door
        :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
        :precondition (and (door ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir)
                           (not (door-open ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir)))
        :effect (door-open ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir)
    )

    (:action move
        :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
        :precondition (and (at ?from)
                           (door-open ?from ?to ?dir))
        :effect (and (not (at ?from))
                     (at ?to))
    )
)
        This is previous problem file: (define (problem explore-problem)
    (:domain explore)
    (:objects 
        kitchen patio plain_room - location
        south west north east - direction
    )
    (:init
        (at kitchen)
        (door kitchen patio south)
        (door patio kitchen north)
        (door kitchen plain_room west)
        (door plain_room kitchen east)
    )
    (:goal (at plain_room))
)
        This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations: None
    
        You made some mistakes when generating those files. Here is the error message: Errors: 0, warnings: 1


        Now modify those two files according to the error message.
