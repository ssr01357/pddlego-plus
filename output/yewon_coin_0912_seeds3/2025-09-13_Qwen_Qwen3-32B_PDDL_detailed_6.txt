This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations: 
Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see a closed plain door. To the West you see the living room. 
Action: move west
You are in the living room. To the South you see a closed screen door. To the East you see the kitchen. To the West you see a closed wood door. 
Action: open door to west
You open the wood door, revealing the bathroom. 
Action: move west
You are in the bathroom. To the South you see a closed wood door. Through an open wood door, to the East you see the living room. To the West you see a closed wood door. 
Action: open door to south
You open the wood door, revealing the corridor. 
Action: move south
You are in the corridor. Through an open wood door, to the North you see the bathroom. To the South you see the driveway. To the East you see a closed patio door. To the West you see a closed wood door.

Prompt: 
    Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
    The format should strictly be:
        {
        "df": "...",
        "pf": "..."
        }

    You are in an environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
    Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
    Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
    Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
    In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
    If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
    Here are your current observations: Action: move south
You are in the driveway. To the North you see the corridor. 

    Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to north', 'move north', 'move west', 'open door to north']
    You should generate df and pf strictly follow this valid actions. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:
    1. :action open-door
        :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
    2. :action move
        :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
    You should have a goal in the problem file like this: 
    (:goal 
        (at ?location)
    ) where ?location should be somewhere not visited, and must be ground (e.g., (at loc_2)), never (at ?l) or quantifiers.

    Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status

This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations: 
Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see a closed plain door. To the West you see the living room. 
Action: move west
You are in the living room. To the South you see a closed screen door. To the East you see the kitchen. To the West you see a closed wood door. 
Action: open door to west
You open the wood door, revealing the bathroom. 
Action: move west
You are in the bathroom. To the South you see a closed wood door. Through an open wood door, to the East you see the living room. To the West you see a closed wood door. 
Action: open door to south
You open the wood door, revealing the corridor. 
Action: move south
You are in the corridor. Through an open wood door, to the North you see the bathroom. To the South you see the driveway. To the East you see a closed patio door. To the West you see a closed wood door.
