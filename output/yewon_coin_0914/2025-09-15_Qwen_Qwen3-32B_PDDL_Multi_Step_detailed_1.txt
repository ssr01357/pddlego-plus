You are in an environment that you explore step by step. Your task is to generate a PDDL domain file ('df') based on the observations and valid actions.
Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.

Here are your current observations: Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the South you see a closed patio door. To the West you see a closed plain door. 

Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to south', 'close door to west', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']

You should generate a df that strictly follows these valid actions. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:
1. :action open-door

2. :action move

You are in an environment that you explore step by step. Your task is to define the objects and the initial state for a PDDL problem file ('pf') based on the provided domain file ('df') and your current observations from the environment.
**DO NOT** generate the `(:goal ...)` section in this step. 

Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.

If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.

You are in an environment that you explore step by step. Your output must be one single, complete PDDL problem file. To create it, add a `(:goal ...)` section to the provided objects and initial state, then wrap everything in the standard `(define (problem ...))` structure.

Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
In other words, your goal should be to go to another not visited location.

    Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
    The format should strictly be:
        {
        "df": "...",
        "pf": "..."
        }

    You are in an environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
    Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
    Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
    Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
    In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
    If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
    Here are your current observations: Action: move north
You are in the backyard. Through an open patio door, to the North you see the kitchen. To the South you see the driveway. To the East you see the street. To the West you see a closed patio door. 

Action: move east
You are in the street. To the North you see a closed sliding door. To the West you see the backyard. 

    Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to south', 'close door to west', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']
    You should generate df and pf strictly follow this valid actions. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:
    1. :action open-door
        :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
    2. :action move
        :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
    You should have a goal in the problem file like this: 
    (:goal 
        (at ?location)
    ) where ?location should be somewhere not visited, and must be ground (e.g., (at loc_2)), never (at ?l) or quantifiers.

    Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status

This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations: 
Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the South you see a closed patio door. To the West you see a closed plain door. 
Action: open door to south
You open the patio door, revealing the backyard. 
Action: move south
You are in the backyard. Through an open patio door, to the North you see the kitchen. To the South you see the driveway. To the East you see the street. To the West you see a closed patio door. 
Action: move south
You are in the driveway. To the North you see the backyard. 
Action: move north
You are in the backyard. Through an open patio door, to the North you see the kitchen. To the South you see the driveway. To the East you see the street. To the West you see a closed patio door.

    Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to south', 'close door to west', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']
    You should generate df and pf strictly follow this valid actions. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:
    1. :action open-door
        :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
    2. :action move
        :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
    You should have a goal in the problem file like this: 
    (:goal 
        (at ?location)
    ) where ?location should be somewhere not visited, and must be ground (e.g., (at loc_2)), never (at ?l) or quantifiers.

    Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status
