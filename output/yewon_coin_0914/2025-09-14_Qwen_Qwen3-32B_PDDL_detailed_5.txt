    You are in an environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
    Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
    Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
    Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
    In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
    If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.

    Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
    The format should strictly be:
        {
        "df": "...",
        "pf": "..."
        }

    You are in an environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
    Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
    Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
    Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
    In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
    If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
    Here are your current observations: Action: move east
You can't move there, the door is closed. 

    Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to north', 'close door to south', 'close door to west', 'move east', 'move north', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to north', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']
    You should generate df and pf strictly follow this valid actions. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:
    1. :action open-door
        :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
    2. :action move
        :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
    You should have a goal in the problem file like this: 
    (:goal 
        (at ?location)
    ) where ?location should be somewhere not visited, and must be ground (e.g., (at loc_2)), never (at ?l) or quantifiers.

    Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status

This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations: 
Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see a closed wood door. To the South you see a closed patio door. To the East you see the living room. To the West you see a closed frosted-glass door. 
Action: move east

You are repeating the same sequence of actions for at least three times. You may stuck in one location or have the wrong goal.
You should revise your problem file to avoid the repeat.
Remember your goal is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet, i.e. your goal should be go to other not visited location but shouldn't be at one fixed location.

Now rewrite both the domain and problem files with the minimal fix.

Now rewrite both the domain and problem files with the minimal fix.

    Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
    The format should strictly be:
        {
        "df": "...",
        "pf": "..."
        }

    You are in an environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
    Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
    Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
    Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
    In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
    If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
    Here are your current observations: Action: move east
You can't move there, the door is closed. 

    Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to north', 'close door to south', 'close door to west', 'move east', 'move north', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to north', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']
    You should generate df and pf strictly follow this valid actions. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:

    2. :action move
        :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
    You should have a goal in the problem file like this: 
    (:goal 
        (at ?location)
    ) where ?location should be somewhere not visited, and must be ground (e.g., (at loc_2)), never (at ?l) or quantifiers.

This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations:

Prompt: 
    Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
    The format should strictly be:
        {
        "df": "...",
        "pf": "..."
        }

    You are in an environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
    Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
    Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
    Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
    In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
    If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
    Here are your current observations: Action: move east
You can't move there, the door is closed. 

    Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to north', 'close door to south', 'close door to west', 'move east', 'move north', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to north', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']
    You should generate df and pf strictly follow this valid actions. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:
    1. :action open-door
        :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
    2. :action move
        :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
    You should have a goal in the problem file like this: 
    (:goal 
        (at ?location)
    ) where ?location should be somewhere not visited, and must be ground (e.g., (at loc_2)), never (at ?l) or quantifiers.

    Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status

This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations: 
Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see a closed wood door. To the South you see a closed patio door. To the East you see the living room. To the West you see a closed frosted-glass door. 
Action: move east
You are in the living room. To the East you see a closed wood door. To the West you see the kitchen. 
Action: move west
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see a closed wood door. To the South you see a closed patio door. To the East you see the living room. To the West you see a closed frosted-glass door. 
Action: move east
You are in the living room. To the East you see a closed wood door. To the West you see the kitchen.

You have already generated df and pf files according to the observations.
This is previous domain file: 
(define (domain exploration)
    (:requirements :strips :typing)
    (:types location direction)
    (:predicates
        (at ?l - location)
        (closed ?from - location ?dir - direction)
    )
    (:action open-door
        :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
        :precondition (and (at ?loc1) (closed ?loc1 ?dir))
        :effect (not (closed ?loc1 ?dir))
    )
    (:action move
        :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
        :precondition (and (at ?from) (not (closed ?from ?dir)))
        :effect (and (not (at ?from)) (at ?to))
    )
)

This is previous problem file: 
(define (problem kitchen-exploration)
    (:domain exploration)
    (:objects
        kitchen - location
        living_room - location
        room_east_living - location
        room_north_kitchen - location
        room_south_kitchen - location
        room_west_kitchen - location
        north south east west - direction
    )
    (:init
        (at kitchen)
        (closed kitchen north)
        (closed kitchen south)
        (closed kitchen west)
        (closed living_room east)
    )
    (:goal
        (at room_south_kitchen)
    )
)


You are repeating the same sequence of actions for at least three times. You may stuck in one location or have the wrong goal.
You should revise your problem file to avoid the repeat.
Remember your goal is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet, i.e. your goal should be go to other not visited location but shouldn't be at one fixed location.

Now rewrite both the domain and problem files with the minimal fix.
