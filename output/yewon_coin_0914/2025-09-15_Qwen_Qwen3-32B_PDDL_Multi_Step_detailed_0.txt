You are in an environment that you explore step by step. Your task is to generate a PDDL domain file ('df') based on the observations and valid actions.
Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.

Here are your current observations: Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see a closed wood door. To the East you see a closed frosted-glass door. To the West you see the corridor. 

Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to east', 'close door to north', 'move east', 'move north', 'move west', 'open door to east', 'open door to north']

You should generate a df that strictly follows these valid actions. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:
1. :action open-door

You are in an environment that you explore step by step. Your task is to define the objects and the initial state for a PDDL problem file ('pf') based on the provided domain file ('df') and your current observations from the environment.
**DO NOT** generate the `(:goal ...)` section in this step. 

Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.

If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.

Prompt: 
    Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
    The format should strictly be:
        {
        "df": "...",
        "pf": "..."
        }

    You are in an environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
    Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
    Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
    Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
    In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
    If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
    Here are your current observations: Action: move west
You are in the corridor. To the North you see a closed wood door. To the South you see a closed wood door. To the East you see the kitchen. To the West you see a closed patio door. 

    Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to east', 'close door to north', 'move east', 'move north', 'move west', 'open door to east', 'open door to north']
    You should generate df and pf strictly follow this valid actions. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:
    1. :action open-door
        :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
    2. :action move
        :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
    You should have a goal in the problem file like this: 
    (:goal 
        (at ?location)
    ) where ?location should be somewhere not visited, and must be ground (e.g., (at loc_2)), never (at ?l) or quantifiers.

    Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status

This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations: 
Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see a closed wood door. To the East you see a closed frosted-glass door. To the West you see the corridor.

    Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to east', 'close door to north', 'move east', 'move north', 'move west', 'open door to east', 'open door to north']
    You should generate df and pf strictly follow this valid actions. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:
    1. :action open-door
        :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
    2. :action move
        :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
    You should have a goal in the problem file like this: 
    (:goal 
        (at ?location)
    ) where ?location should be somewhere not visited, and must be ground (e.g., (at loc_2)), never (at ?l) or quantifiers.

    Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status

    The format should strictly be:
        {
        "df": "...",
        "pf": "..."
        }

    You are in an environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
    Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
    Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
    Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
    In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
    If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
    Here are your current observations: Action: move west
You can't move there, the door is closed. 

Action: open door to west
You open the patio door, revealing the backyard. 

Action: move west
You are in the backyard. To the North you see the driveway. To the South you see a closed screen door. Through an open patio door, to the East you see the corridor. To the West you see the street. 

    Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to east', 'close door to north', 'move east', 'move north', 'move west', 'open door to east', 'open door to north']
    You should generate df and pf strictly follow this valid actions. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:

    You should have a goal in the problem file like this: 
    (:goal

    ) where ?location should be somewhere not visited, and must be ground (e.g., (at loc_2)), never (at ?l) or quantifiers.

    Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
    The format should strictly be:
        {
        "df": "...",
        "pf": "..."
        }

    You are in an environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
    Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
    Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
    Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
    In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
    If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
    Here are your current observations: Action: move south
You are in the backyard. To the North you see the driveway. To the South you see a closed screen door. Through an open patio door, to the East you see the corridor. To the West you see the street. 

Action: open door to east
That is already open. 

Action: move east
You are in the corridor. To the North you see a closed wood door. To the South you see a closed wood door. To the East you see the kitchen. Through an open patio door, to the West you see the backyard. 

Action: open door to north
You open the wood door, revealing the bathroom. 

Action: move north
You are in the bathroom. Through an open wood door, to the South you see the corridor. To the East you see a closed wood door. 

    Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to east', 'close door to north', 'move east', 'move north', 'move west', 'open door to east', 'open door to north']
    You should generate df and pf strictly follow this valid actions. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:

    2. :action move
        :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
    You should have a goal in the problem file like this:

    ) where ?location should be somewhere not visited, and must be ground (e.g., (at loc_2)), never (at ?l) or quantifiers.

Prompt: 
    Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
    The format should strictly be:
        {
        "df": "...",
        "pf": "..."
        }

    You are in an environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
    Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
    Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
    Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
    In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
    If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
    Here are your current observations: Action: move south
You are in the backyard. To the North you see the driveway. To the South you see a closed screen door. Through an open patio door, to the East you see the corridor. To the West you see the street. 

Action: open door to east
That is already open. 

Action: move east
You are in the corridor. To the North you see a closed wood door. To the South you see a closed wood door. To the East you see the kitchen. Through an open patio door, to the West you see the backyard. 

Action: open door to north
You open the wood door, revealing the bathroom. 

Action: move north
You are in the bathroom. Through an open wood door, to the South you see the corridor. To the East you see a closed wood door. 

    Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to east', 'close door to north', 'move east', 'move north', 'move west', 'open door to east', 'open door to north']
    You should generate df and pf strictly follow this valid actions. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:
    1. :action open-door
        :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
    2. :action move
        :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
    You should have a goal in the problem file like this: 
    (:goal 
        (at ?location)
    ) where ?location should be somewhere not visited, and must be ground (e.g., (at loc_2)), never (at ?l) or quantifiers.

    Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status

This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations:
