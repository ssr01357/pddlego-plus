        :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
    You should have a goal in the problem file like this: 
    (:goal 
        (at ?location)
    ) where ?location should be somewhere not visited, and must be ground (e.g., (at loc_2)), never (at ?l) or quantifiers.

    Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status

This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations: 
Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see the living room. To the South you see a closed wood door. To the East you see a closed frosted-glass door. To the West you see a closed sliding patio door. 
Action: open door to south
You open the wood door, revealing the laundry room. 
Action: move south
You are in the laundry room. Through an open wood door, to the North you see the kitchen. 
Action: move north
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see the living room. Through an open wood door, to the South you see the laundry room. To the East you see a closed frosted-glass door. To the West you see a closed sliding patio door. 
Action: move north
You are in the living room. To the South you see the kitchen. To the East you see a closed wood door. To the West you see the corridor. 
Action: move north
Unknown action: I'm not sure what you mean.
Action: move west
You are in the corridor. To the North you see a closed wood door. To the South you see a closed screen door. To the East you see the living room. To the West you see the driveway. 


You have already generated df and pf files according to the observations.
This is previous domain file: 
(define (domain exploration)
    (:requirements :strips :typing)
    (:types location direction)
    (:predicates 
        (at ?l - location)

        :precondition (and (at ?loc1) (direction ?dir ?loc1 ?loc2) (closed ?dir ?loc1 ?loc2))
        :effect (and (open ?dir ?loc1 ?loc2) (not (closed ?dir ?loc1 ?loc2)))

Now rewrite both the domain and problem files with the minimal fix.
