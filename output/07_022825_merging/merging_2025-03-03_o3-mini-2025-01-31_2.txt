Observations: You are in the kitchen. In one part of the room you see a stove. There is also an oven. You also see a fridge that is closed. In another part of the room you see a counter, that has nothing on it. In one part of the room you see a kitchen cupboard that is closed. There is also a cutlery drawer that is closed. You also see a trash can that is closed. In another part of the room you see a dishwasher that is closed. In one part of the room you see a dining chair, that has nothing on it. 
To the South you see a closed patio door. To the West you see a closed plain door.

Prompt: You are in an environment that you explore step by step. Your job is to build and update the PDDL files (both the domain file and the problem file) strictly based on your observations—do not add information that has not been observed. In particular:
        - Do not invent objects or rooms that are not mentioned in the observations.
        - If you see a closed door, assume there may be a room behind it—but only include it if supported by the observation.
        - Do not assume a door connects two rooms unless it is clearly observed.
        - Your overall goal is to keep exploring and reach a location that has not yet been visited.

        You have the following valid actions available (and you must follow these exactly):
        1. **:action open-door**  
        :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
        2. **:action move**  
        :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)

        Additionally, your problem file must include a goal section exactly in this format:
        (:goal (at ?location) )

        where “?location” is replaced with a location that has not been visited.

        The current domain file is provided here:

        - If the domain file is not empty, check and, if necessary, revise it according to your understanding or the following error messages:  and .

        Now, you are tasked with building a PDDL **problem file** from scratch based solely on the following observation:
        Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the South you see a closed patio door. To the West you see a closed plain door. 

        *Note: You do not have access to any previous problem file.*

        Your goals for generating the problem file are:
        - Include only the relevant objects, initial states, and goals that directly reflect this observation.
        - Ensure the problem file is self-contained (i.e., it must include the sections (:objects ...), (:init ...), and (:goal ...)).
        - Use the objects or actions defined in the domain file if necessary, but do not assume any external information.
