        You are in an environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
        Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
        Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
        Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
        In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.

        You should generate df and pf strictly follow this valid actions. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:
        1. :action open-door
            :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
        2. :action move
            :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
        You should have a goal in the problem file like this: 
        (:goal 
            (at ?location)
        ) where location should be somewhere not visited
        Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status
    
        This is previous domain file: (define (domain house-exploration)
(:predicates
    (at ?loc - location)
    (door-closed ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
    (door-open ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
)
(:action open-door
    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
    :precondition (door-closed ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir)
    :effect (and (door-open ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir) (not (door-closed ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir)))
)
(:action move
    :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
    :precondition (door-open ?from ?to ?dir)
    :effect (and (at ?to) (not (at ?from)))
)
)
        This is previous problem file: (define (problem explore-house-and-backyard)
(:domain house-exploration)
(:objects
    kitchen patio another_room backyard driveway street - location
    north south east west - direction
)
(:init
    (at backyard)
    (door-closed kitchen patio south)
    (door-closed kitchen another_room west)
    (door-open backyard kitchen north)
    (door-closed backyard street east)
)
(:goal
    (and (at patio) (at driveway))
)
)
        This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations: Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the South you see a closed patio door. To the West you see a closed plain door. 
Action: open door to south
You open the patio door, revealing the backyard. 
Action: move south
You are in the backyard. Through an open patio door, to the North you see the kitchen. To the South you see the driveway. To the East you see the street. To the West you see a closed patio door. 

    
        You made some mistakes when generating those files. Here is the error message: None; 
        Now modify those two files according to the error message.
    
        You have already generate files according to the observations. The df and pf can generate actions but after simulating,
        it got those errors: Invalid action: open door to south.. Please review both files and fix them.
        Now modify those two files according to the error message.
