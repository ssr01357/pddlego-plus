You are in a partially observable environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.

Prompt: 
    Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
    The format should strictly be:
        {
        "df": "...",
        "pf": "..."
        }


You are in a partially observable environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
Here are your current observations: Action: move east
You are in the driveway. To the South you see the backyard. To the West you see the corridor. 

Here are some valid actions you can take: ['move east', 'move north', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to east', 'open door to north', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']
You should generate df and pf that strictly follow these action schemas. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:
1. :action open-door
    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
2. :action move
    :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
You should have a goal in the problem file like this: 
(:goal 
    (at ?location)
) 


Note: 
- In problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status.
- In problem file's goal, ?location must be grounded, no variables or quantifiers.


This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations: 
Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see the corridor. To the South you see a closed plain door. To the East you see a closed patio door. To the West you see a closed wood door. 
Action: move north
You are in the corridor. To the South you see the kitchen. To the East you see the driveway. To the West you see a closed wood door. 
Action: move east
You are in the driveway. To the South you see the backyard. To the West you see the corridor. 


You have already generated df and pf files according to the observations.

 You open the sliding door, revealing the supermarket.  
Small Loop, action_queue: ['move east']

 You are in the supermarket. In one part of the room you see a showcase, that has nothing on it. 
Through an open sliding door, to the West you see the street.

Prompt: 
    Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
    The format should strictly be:
        {
        "df": "...",
        "pf": "..."
        }


You are in a partially observable environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
Here are your current observations: Action: open door to east
You open the sliding door, revealing the supermarket. 

Action: move east
You are in the supermarket. Through an open sliding door, to the West you see the street. 

Here are some valid actions you can take: ['move east', 'move north', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to east', 'open door to north', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']
You should generate df and pf that strictly follow these action schemas. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:
1. :action open-door
    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
2. :action move
    :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
You should have a goal in the problem file like this: 
(:goal 
    (at ?location)
) 


Note: 
- In problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status.
- In problem file's goal, ?location must be grounded, no variables or quantifiers.


This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations: 
Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see the corridor. To the South you see a closed plain door. To the East you see a closed patio door. To the West you see a closed wood door. 
Action: move north
You are in the corridor. To the South you see the kitchen. To the East you see the driveway. To the West you see a closed wood door. 
Action: move east
You are in the driveway. To the South you see the backyard. To the West you see the corridor. 
Action: move south
You are in the backyard. To the North you see the driveway. To the East you see the street. To the West you see a closed patio door. 
Action: move east
You are in the street. To the East you see a closed sliding door. To the West you see the backyard. 
Action: open door to east
You open the sliding door, revealing the supermarket. 
Action: move east
You are in the supermarket. Through an open sliding door, to the West you see the street. 


You have already generated df and pf files according to the observations.
