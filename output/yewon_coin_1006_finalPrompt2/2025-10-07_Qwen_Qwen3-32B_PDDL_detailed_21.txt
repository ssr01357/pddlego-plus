You are in a partially observable environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.

You should generate df and pf that strictly follow these action schemas. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:

You are in a partially observable environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
Here are your current observations: Action: move west
You are in the driveway. To the East you see the corridor. 

Here are some valid actions you can take: ['move east', 'move north', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to east', 'open door to north', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']
You should generate df and pf that strictly follow these action schemas. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:
1. :action open-door
    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
2. :action move
    :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
You should have a goal in the problem file like this:

Note: 
- In problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status.

    The format should strictly be:
        {
        "df": "...",
        "pf": "..."
        }


You are in a partially observable environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
Here are your current observations: Action: move east
You are in the living room. To the North you see a closed wood door. To the South you see the kitchen. To the West you see the corridor. 

Action: move south
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see the living room. To the South you see a closed wood door. To the East you see a closed plain door. To the West you see a closed wood door. 

Here are some valid actions you can take: ['move east', 'move north', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to east', 'open door to north', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']
You should generate df and pf that strictly follow these action schemas. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:
1. :action open-door
    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
2. :action move
    :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
You should have a goal in the problem file like this: 
(:goal 
    (at ?location)
) 


Note: 
- In problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status.
- In problem file's goal, ?location must be grounded, no variables or quantifiers.


This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations: 
Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see the living room. To the South you see a closed wood door. To the East you see a closed plain door. To the West you see a closed wood door. 
Action: move north
You are in the living room. To the North you see a closed wood door. To the South you see the kitchen. To the West you see the corridor.

You are in a partially observable environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
Here are your current observations: Action: move north
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see the living room. Through an open wood door, to the South you see the bathroom. To the East you see a closed plain door. To the West you see a closed wood door. 

Action: open door to east
You open the plain door, revealing the pantry. 

Action: move east
You are in the pantry. Through an open plain door, to the West you see the kitchen. 

Here are some valid actions you can take: ['move east', 'move north', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to east', 'open door to north', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']
You should generate df and pf that strictly follow these action schemas. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:
1. :action open-door
    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
2. :action move
    :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
You should have a goal in the problem file like this: 
(:goal 
    (at ?location)
) 


Note: 
- In problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status.
- In problem file's goal, ?location must be grounded, no variables or quantifiers.


This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations: 
Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see the living room. To the South you see a closed wood door. To the East you see a closed plain door. To the West you see a closed wood door. 
Action: move north
You are in the living room. To the North you see a closed wood door. To the South you see the kitchen. To the West you see the corridor. 
Action: move west
You are in the corridor. To the North you see a closed screen door. To the South you see a closed wood door. To the East you see the living room. To the West you see the driveway. 
Action: move west
You are in the driveway. To the East you see the corridor. 
Action: move east
You are in the corridor. To the North you see a closed screen door. To the South you see a closed wood door. To the East you see the living room. To the West you see the driveway. 
Action: move east
You are in the living room. To the North you see a closed wood door. To the South you see the kitchen. To the West you see the corridor. 
Action: move south
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see the living room. To the South you see a closed wood door. To the East you see a closed plain door. To the West you see a closed wood door. 
Action: open door to south
You open the wood door, revealing the bathroom. 
Action: move south
You are in the bathroom. Through an open wood door, to the North you see the kitchen. 
Action: move north
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see the living room. Through an open wood door, to the South you see the bathroom. To the East you see a closed plain door. To the West you see a closed wood door. 
Action: open door to east
You open the plain door, revealing the pantry. 
Action: move east
You are in the pantry. Through an open plain door, to the West you see the kitchen.

Based on the df and pf that you generated, the external solver could generate a plan but after simulating in the game environment, it caused those errors: 
This is the action you take: move north. You cannot move to that direction.
