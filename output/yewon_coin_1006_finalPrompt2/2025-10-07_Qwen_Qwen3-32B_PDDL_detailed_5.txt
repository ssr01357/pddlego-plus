Observations: You are in the kitchen. In one part of the room you see a stove. There is also an oven. You also see a fridge that is closed. In another part of the room you see a counter, that has nothing on it. In one part of the room you see a kitchen cupboard that is closed. There is also a cutlery drawer that is closed. You also see a trash can that is closed. In another part of the room you see a dishwasher that is closed. In one part of the room you see a dining chair, that has nothing on it. 
To the North you see a closed wood door. To the South you see a closed patio door. To the East you see the living room. To the West you see a closed frosted-glass door.

    Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
    The format should strictly be:
        {
        "df": "...",
        "pf": "..."
        }


You are in a partially observable environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
Here are your current observations: Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see a closed wood door. To the South you see a closed patio door. To the East you see the living room. To the West you see a closed frosted-glass door. 

Here are some valid actions you can take: ['move east', 'move north', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to east', 'open door to north', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']
You should generate df and pf that strictly follow these action schemas. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:
1. :action open-door
    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
2. :action move
    :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
You should have a goal in the problem file like this: 
(:goal 
    (at ?location)
) 


Note: 
- In problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status.
- In problem file's goal, ?location must be grounded, no variables or quantifiers.
