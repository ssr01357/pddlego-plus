You are in a partially observable environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
Here are your current observations: Action: look around

Here are some valid actions you can take: ['move east', 'move north', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to east', 'open door to north', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']
You should generate df and pf that strictly follow these action schemas. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:
1. :action open-door

2. :action move

You should have a goal in the problem file like this:

Note: 
- In problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status.

Prompt: 
    Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
    The format should strictly be:
        {
        "df": "...",
        "pf": "..."
        }


You are in a partially observable environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
Here are your current observations: Action: move south
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see the living room. To the South you see a closed wood door. To the East you see a closed frosted-glass door. To the West you see the corridor. 

Action: open door to east
You open the frosted-glass door, revealing the pantry. 

Action: move east
You are in the pantry. Through an open frosted-glass door, to the West you see the kitchen. 

Here are some valid actions you can take: ['move east', 'move north', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to east', 'open door to north', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']
You should generate df and pf that strictly follow these action schemas. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:
1. :action open-door
    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
2. :action move
    :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
You should have a goal in the problem file like this: 
(:goal 
    (at ?location)
) 


Note: 
- In problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status.
- In problem file's goal, ?location must be grounded, no variables or quantifiers.


This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations: 
Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see the living room. To the South you see a closed wood door. To the East you see a closed frosted-glass door. To the West you see the corridor. 
Action: move west
You are in the corridor. To the North you see a closed wood door. To the South you see a closed wood door. To the East you see the kitchen. To the West you see a closed screen door. 
Action: open door to north
You open the wood door, revealing the bedroom. 
Action: move north
You are in the bedroom. Through an open wood door, to the South you see the corridor. To the East you see a closed wood door. 
Action: open door to east
You open the wood door, revealing the living room. 
Action: move east
You are in the living room. To the South you see the kitchen. Through an open wood door, to the West you see the bedroom. 
Action: move south
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see the living room. To the South you see a closed wood door. To the East you see a closed frosted-glass door. To the West you see the corridor.

Based on the df and pf that you generated, the external solver could generate a plan but after simulating in the game environment, it caused those errors: 
This is the action you take: open door to east. When you try to open door, there is no door here or there is nothing in this direction. If there is no door, you can directly move to that direction.

Prompt: 
    Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
    The format should strictly be:
        {
        "df": "...",
        "pf": "..."
        }


You are in a partially observable environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
Here are your current observations: Action: open door to south
Unknown action: I'm not sure what you mean.

Here are some valid actions you can take: ['move east', 'move north', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to east', 'open door to north', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']
You should generate df and pf that strictly follow these action schemas. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:
1. :action open-door
    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
2. :action move
    :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
You should have a goal in the problem file like this: 
(:goal 
    (at ?location)
) 


Note: 
- In problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status.
- In problem file's goal, ?location must be grounded, no variables or quantifiers.


This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations: 
Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see the living room. To the South you see a closed wood door. To the East you see a closed frosted-glass door. To the West you see the corridor. 
Action: move west
You are in the corridor. To the North you see a closed wood door. To the South you see a closed wood door. To the East you see the kitchen. To the West you see a closed screen door. 
Action: open door to north
You open the wood door, revealing the bedroom. 
Action: move north
You are in the bedroom. Through an open wood door, to the South you see the corridor. To the East you see a closed wood door. 
Action: open door to east
You open the wood door, revealing the living room. 
Action: move east
You are in the living room. To the South you see the kitchen. Through an open wood door, to the West you see the bedroom. 
Action: move south
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see the living room. To the South you see a closed wood door. To the East you see a closed frosted-glass door. To the West you see the corridor. 
Action: open door to east
You open the frosted-glass door, revealing the pantry. 
Action: move east
You are in the pantry. Through an open frosted-glass door, to the West you see the kitchen. 
Action: move west
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see the living room. To the South you see a closed wood door. Through an open frosted-glass door, to the East you see the pantry. To the West you see the corridor. 
Action: open door to south
You open the wood door, revealing the laundry room. 
Action: move south
You are in the laundry room. Through an open wood door, to the North you see the kitchen. To the West you see a closed wood door.

Based on the df and pf that you generated, the external solver could generate a plan but after simulating in the game environment, it caused those errors: 
This is the action you take: open door to south. When you try to open door, there is no door here or there is nothing in this direction. If there is no door, you can directly move to that direction.



Now rewrite both the domain and problem files with the minimal fix.
