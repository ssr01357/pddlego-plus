You are in a partially observable environment that you explore step by step. Your task is to generate a PDDL domain file ('df') based on the observations and valid actions.
Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.

Here are your current observations: Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see the living room. To the South you see a closed wood door. To the East you see a closed frosted-glass door. To the West you see the corridor. 

Here are some valid actions you can take: ['move east', 'move north', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to east', 'open door to north', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']

You should generate a df that strictly follows these valid actions. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:
1. :action open-door

You are in a partially observable environment that you explore step by step. Your task is to define the objects and the initial state for a PDDL problem file ('pf') based on the provided domain file ('df') and your current observations from the environment.
**DO NOT** generate the `(:goal ...)` section in this step. 

Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.

If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.

You are in a partially observable environment that you explore step by step. Your output must be one single, complete PDDL problem file. To create it, add a `(:goal ...)` section to the provided objects and initial state, then wrap everything in the standard `(define (problem ...))` structure.

Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
In other words, your goal should be to go to another not visited location.

 You are in the kitchen. In one part of the room you see a stove. There is also an oven. You also see a fridge that is closed. In another part of the room you see a counter, that has nothing on it. In one part of the room you see a kitchen cupboard that is closed. There is also a cutlery drawer that is closed. You also see a trash can that is closed. In another part of the room you see a dishwasher that is closed. In one part of the room you see a dining chair, that has nothing on it. 
To the North you see the living room. To the South you see a closed wood door. To the East you see a closed frosted-glass door. To the West you see the corridor.

    Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
    The format should strictly be:
        {
        "df": "...",
        "pf": "..."
        }


You are in a partially observable environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
Here are your current observations: Action: move east
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see the living room. To the South you see a closed wood door. To the East you see a closed frosted-glass door. To the West you see the corridor. 

Here are some valid actions you can take: ['move east', 'move north', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to east', 'open door to north', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']
You should generate df and pf that strictly follow these action schemas. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:
1. :action open-door
    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
2. :action move
    :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
You should have a goal in the problem file like this: 
(:goal 
    (at ?location)
) 


Note: 
- In problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status.
- In problem file's goal, ?location must be grounded, no variables or quantifiers.


This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations: 
Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see the living room. To the South you see a closed wood door. To the East you see a closed frosted-glass door. To the West you see the corridor. 
Action: move west
You are in the corridor. To the North you see a closed wood door. To the South you see a closed wood door. To the East you see the kitchen. To the West you see a closed screen door. 
Action: move east
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see the living room. To the South you see a closed wood door. To the East you see a closed frosted-glass door. To the West you see the corridor. 
Action: move west
You are in the corridor. To the North you see a closed wood door. To the South you see a closed wood door. To the East you see the kitchen. To the West you see a closed screen door.

You are in a partially observable environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
Here are your current observations: Action: open door to north
You open the wood door, revealing the bedroom. 

Action: move north
You are in the bedroom. Through an open wood door, to the South you see the corridor. To the East you see a closed wood door. 

Here are some valid actions you can take: ['move east', 'move north', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to east', 'open door to north', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']
You should generate df and pf that strictly follow these action schemas. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:
1. :action open-door
    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
2. :action move
    :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
You should have a goal in the problem file like this: 
(:goal 
    (at ?location)
) 


Note: 
- In problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status.
- In problem file's goal, ?location must be grounded, no variables or quantifiers.

Prompt: 
    Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
    The format should strictly be:
        {
        "df": "...",
        "pf": "..."
        }


You are in a partially observable environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
Here are your current observations: Action: move west
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see the living room. To the South you see a closed wood door. Through an open frosted-glass door, to the East you see the pantry. To the West you see the corridor. 

Action: move west
You are in the corridor. Through an open wood door, to the North you see the bedroom. To the South you see a closed wood door. To the East you see the kitchen. To the West you see a closed screen door. 

Action: open door to north
That is already open. 

Here are some valid actions you can take: ['move east', 'move north', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to east', 'open door to north', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']
You should generate df and pf that strictly follow these action schemas. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:
1. :action open-door
    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
2. :action move
    :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
You should have a goal in the problem file like this: 
(:goal 
    (at ?location)
) 


Note: 
- In problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status.
- In problem file's goal, ?location must be grounded, no variables or quantifiers.


This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations:

Based on the df and pf that you generated, the external solver could generate a plan but after simulating in the game environment, it caused those errors: 
This is the action you take: open door to north. You try to open a door that is already open. You already visited here. Make sure the status of door is correct.

Prompt: 
    Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
    The format should strictly be:
        {
        "df": "...",
        "pf": "..."
        }


You are in a partially observable environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
Here are your current observations: Action: move south
Unknown action: I'm not sure what you mean.

Here are some valid actions you can take: ['move east', 'move north', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to east', 'open door to north', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']
You should generate df and pf that strictly follow these action schemas. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:
1. :action open-door
    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
2. :action move
    :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
You should have a goal in the problem file like this: 
(:goal 
    (at ?location)
) 


Note: 
- In problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status.
- In problem file's goal, ?location must be grounded, no variables or quantifiers.


This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations:

Based on the df and pf that you generated, the external solver could generate a plan but after simulating in the game environment, it caused those errors: 
This is the action you take: move south. You cannot move to that direction.


Now rewrite both the domain and problem files with the minimal fix.
