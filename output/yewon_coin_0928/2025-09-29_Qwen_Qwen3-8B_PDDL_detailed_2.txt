    Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
    The format should strictly be:
        {
        "df": "...",
        "pf": "..."
        }

    You are in an environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
    Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
    Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
    Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
    In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
    If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
    Here are your current observations: Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see the living room. To the South you see a closed wood door. To the East you see a closed frosted-glass door. To the West you see a closed sliding patio door.

    You should generate df and pf strictly follow this valid actions. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:

    2. :action move
        :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
    You should have a goal in the problem file like this: 
    (:goal 
        (at ?location)
    ) where ?location should be somewhere not visited, and must be ground (e.g., (at loc_2)), never (at ?l) or quantifiers.

 You are in the living room. In one part of the room you see a wastepaper basket that is closed. There is also a book case, that has nothing on it. You also see a TV stand, that has nothing on it. In another part of the room you see a arm chair, that has nothing on it. In one part of the room you see a side table, that has nothing on it. There is also a coffee table, that has nothing on it. You also see a end table, that has nothing on it. In another part of the room you see a sofa, that has nothing on it. 
To the South you see the kitchen. To the East you see a closed wood door. To the West you see the corridor.

Prompt: 
    Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
    The format should strictly be:
        {
        "df": "...",
        "pf": "..."
        }

    You are in an environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
    Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
    Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
    Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
    In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
    If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
    Here are your current observations: Action: move north
You are in the living room. To the South you see the kitchen. To the East you see a closed wood door. To the West you see the corridor. 

    Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to east', 'move east', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to east']
    You should generate df and pf strictly follow this valid actions. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:
    1. :action open-door
        :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
    2. :action move
        :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
    You should have a goal in the problem file like this: 
    (:goal 
        (at ?location)
    ) where ?location should be somewhere not visited, and must be ground (e.g., (at loc_2)), never (at ?l) or quantifiers.

    Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status

This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations: 
Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the North you see the living room. To the South you see a closed wood door. To the East you see a closed frosted-glass door. To the West you see a closed sliding patio door. 
Action: move north
You are in the living room. To the South you see the kitchen. To the East you see a closed wood door. To the West you see the corridor. 


You have already generated df and pf files according to the observations.
This is previous domain file:

Now rewrite both the domain and problem files with the minimal fix.

> move west 
 You are in the corridor. In one part of the room you see a key holder, that has nothing on it. There is also a shoe cabinet that is closed. You also see a umbrella stand, that has nothing on it. In another part of the room you see a hat rack, that has nothing on it. In one part of the room you see a coat hanger, that has nothing on it. 
To the North you see a closed wood door. To the South you see a closed screen door. To the East you see the living room. To the West you see the driveway.
