    You are in an environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
    Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
    Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
    Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
    In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
    If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
    Here are your current observations: Action: move south
You can't move there, the door is closed. 

    Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to north', 'close door to south', 'close door to west', 'move east', 'move north', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to north', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']
    You should generate df and pf strictly follow this valid actions. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:

    2. :action move
        :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
    You should have a goal in the problem file like this: 
    (:goal 
        (at ?location)
    ) where ?location should be somewhere not visited, and must be ground (e.g., (at loc_2)), never (at ?l) or quantifiers.

    Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status

This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations: 
Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the South you see a closed frosted-glass door. To the West you see the corridor. 
Action: move west
You are in the corridor. To the North you see a closed patio door. To the South you see a closed wood door. To the East you see the kitchen. To the West you see a closed wood door. 
Action: move north

    You are in an environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
    Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
    Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
    Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
    In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
    If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
    Here are your current observations: Action: move north
You can't move there, the door is closed. 

    Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to north', 'close door to south', 'close door to west', 'move east', 'move north', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to north', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']
    You should generate df and pf strictly follow this valid actions. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:

    2. :action move
        :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
    You should have a goal in the problem file like this: 
    (:goal 
        (at ?location)
    ) where ?location should be somewhere not visited, and must be ground (e.g., (at loc_2)), never (at ?l) or quantifiers.

    Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status

This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations: 
Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the South you see a closed frosted-glass door. To the West you see the corridor. 
Action: move west
You are in the corridor. To the North you see a closed patio door. To the South you see a closed wood door. To the East you see the kitchen. To the West you see a closed wood door.

    The format should strictly be:

    You are in an environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
    Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
    Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
    Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
    In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
    If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
    Here are your current observations: Action: move south
You can't move there, the door is closed. 

    Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to north', 'close door to south', 'close door to west', 'move east', 'move north', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to north', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']
    You should generate df and pf strictly follow this valid actions. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:

        :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
    2. :action move
        :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
    You should have a goal in the problem file like this: 
    (:goal 
        (at ?location)
    ) where ?location should be somewhere not visited, and must be ground (e.g., (at loc_2)), never (at ?l) or quantifiers.

    Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status

This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations: 
Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the South you see a closed frosted-glass door. To the West you see the corridor. 
Action: move west
You are in the corridor. To the North you see a closed patio door. To the South you see a closed wood door. To the East you see the kitchen. To the West you see a closed wood door.

You are repeating the same sequence of actions for at least three times. You may stuck in one location or have the wrong goal.
You should revise your problem file to avoid the repeat.
Remember your goal is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet, i.e. your goal should be go to other not visited location but shouldn't be at one fixed location.

Now rewrite both the domain and problem files with the minimal fix.

You are repeating the same sequence of actions for at least three times. You may stuck in one location or have the wrong goal.
You should revise your problem file to avoid the repeat.
Remember your goal is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet, i.e. your goal should be go to other not visited location but shouldn't be at one fixed location.

Now rewrite both the domain and problem files with the minimal fix.

    You are in an environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
    Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
    Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
    Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
    In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
    If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.

    Please provide the output in strict JSON format, without any additional text or explanation, including a PDDL domain file as 'df' and a PDDL problem file as 'pf'. 
    The format should strictly be:
        {
        "df": "...",
        "pf": "..."
        }

    You are in an environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
    Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
    Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
    Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
    In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
    If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
    Here are your current observations: Action: move west
You can't move there, the door is closed. 

    Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to north', 'close door to south', 'close door to west', 'move east', 'move north', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to north', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']
    You should generate df and pf strictly follow this valid actions. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:
    1. :action open-door
        :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
    2. :action move
        :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
    You should have a goal in the problem file like this: 
    (:goal 
        (at ?location)
    ) where ?location should be somewhere not visited, and must be ground (e.g., (at loc_2)), never (at ?l) or quantifiers.

    Note: in problem file's init, you shouldn't have "not ()" but only the single status

This is all the memory you have in this game including each action and its corresponding observations: 
Action: look around
You are in the kitchen. To the South you see a closed frosted-glass door. To the West you see the corridor. 
Action: move west
You are in the corridor. To the North you see a closed patio door. To the South you see a closed wood door. To the East you see the kitchen. To the West you see a closed wood door. 
Action: move north
You can't move there, the door is closed. 
Action: move north
You can't move there, the door is closed. 
Action: move south
You can't move there, the door is closed. 
Action: move south
You can't move there, the door is closed. 
Action: move south
You can't move there, the door is closed. 
Action: move north

Action: move west
You can't move there, the door is closed. 
Action: move south
You can't move there, the door is closed. 
Action: move south
You can't move there, the door is closed. 
Action: move west
You can't move there, the door is closed. 
Action: move west
You can't move there, the door is closed. 


You have already generated df and pf files according to the observations.
This is previous domain file: 
(define (domain exploration)
    (:requirements :strips :typing)
    (:types location direction)
    (:predicates
        (at ?l - location)
        (closed ?d - direction)
        (adjacent ?l1 - location ?l2 - location ?d - direction)
    )
    (:action open-door
        :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)
        :precondition (and (closed ?dir) (adjacent ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir))
        :effect (and (not (closed ?dir)) (at ?loc2))
    )
    (:action move
        :parameters (?from - location ?to - location ?dir - direction)
        :precondition (and (at ?from) (adjacent ?from ?to ?dir))
        :effect (and (not (at ?from)) (at ?to))
    )
)

This is previous problem file: 
(define (problem exploration)
    (:domain exploration)
    (:objects kitchen - location corridor - location room_2 - location patio - location room_3 - location north - direction south - direction west - direction east - direction)
    (:init
        (at corridor)
        (closed north)
        (closed south)
        (closed west)
        (adjacent kitchen corridor west)
        (adjacent corridor room_2 south)
        (adjacent corridor patio north)
        (adjacent corridor room_3 west)
        (adjacent corridor kitchen east)
    )
    (:goal (at room_3))
)


Now rewrite both the domain and problem files with the minimal fix.
