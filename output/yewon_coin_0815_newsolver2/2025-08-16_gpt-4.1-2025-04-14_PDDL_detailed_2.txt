    The format should strictly be:

    You are in an environment that you explore step by step. You must build and update PDDL files of the environment based on only your observations. 
    Do not create something not appeared in the observations and also do not miss any observations e.g. through closed doors you may assume a room behind.
    Do not assume that there will be a door connecting rooms.
    Your task is always to keep exploration and go to a location you have not visited yet.
    In other words, your goal should go to other not visited location.
    If you enter a room, make sure you put everything you observed such as the direction in the problem file.
    Here are your current observations: Action: open door to south
You open the patio door, revealing the backyard. 

Action: move south
You are in the backyard. Through an open patio door, to the North you see the kitchen. To the South you see the driveway. To the East you see the street. To the West you see a closed patio door. 

    Here are some valid actions you can take: ['close door to south', 'close door to west', 'move south', 'move west', 'open door to south', 'open door to west']
    You should generate df and pf strictly follow this valid actions. There are in total 2 actions, that should exactly be the following two:
